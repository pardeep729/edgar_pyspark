retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents
counsel&#146;s best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will

2008, ACAC has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a &#147;<U>REIT</U>&#148;) under the Code, and its actual method of operation through the date of this
opinion has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will continue to enable, it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for its taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2010 and subsequent years. As noted in the Offering
Documents, ACAC&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, its distribution levels and the
diversity of its stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of ACAC&#146;s operations for any one taxable
year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2. Although the discussion set forth in the
