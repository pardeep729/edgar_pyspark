declared to be incompetent or to a person the Administrator in good faith believes to be
incompetent or incapable of handling the disposition of property, the Administrator may direct
payment of such Plan benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and
custody of such minor and such decision by the Administrator is binding on all parties. The
Administrator may initiate whatever action it deems appropriate to ensure that benefits are
properly paid to an appropriate guardian.

the acceleration of any installment payments being made from the Plan, but only to the extent
reasonably necessary to relieve the Unforeseeable Emergency, including federal, state, local, or
foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably imposed upon the distribution. In any event, payment
may not be made to the extent such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be satisfied through
reimbursement by insurance or otherwise, including, but not limited to, liquidation of the
Participant&#146;s assets (but not including hardship deferrals or loans from the Participant&#146;s account
in any qualified retirement plan, as defined in Treasury Regulations &#167;1.409A-1(a)(2)), to the

Participant demonstrates the existence of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Administrator shall first
cancel the Participant&#146;s Deferrals for the Plan Year (other than Deferrals of Restricted Stock
Units pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.3), and the amount of the distribution required to relieve the
Unforeseeable Emergency shall take into account the additional income available to the Participant
as the result of cancellation of such Deferrals. The Administrator may also impose such other
conditions upon a distribution as it determines in its discretion to be appropriate and not
inconsistent with &#167;409A of the Code.

secondary, to whom benefits under this Plan will be paid in the event of the Participant&#146;s death

Beneficiary by the filing of a new Beneficiary designation with the Administrator. Filing a
Beneficiary designation as to any benefits available under the Plan revokes all prior Beneficiary
designations effective as of the date such Beneficiary designation is received by the
Administrator. If a Participant&#146;s Account is community property, any Beneficiary designation will
be valid or effective only as permitted under applicable law.

Participant and before payment of benefits under this Plan has been completed, and no secondary
Beneficiary has been designated to receive such Beneficiary&#146;s share, the remaining benefits will be
payable to the Beneficiary&#146;s estate.
