provided that the amount paid shall not exceed the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the emergency. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;2, an unforeseeable financial emergency is an unanticipated emergency that is caused by an event beyond the
control of the Participant as may result from illness, casualty loss or sudden financial reversal and that would result in severe financial hardship to the individual if the emergency distribution were not permitted. Financial needs arising from
foreseeable events, such as the purchase of a residence or education expenses for children, shall not be considered a financial emergency. A Participant who receives a hardship distribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2 shall be ineligible to make
