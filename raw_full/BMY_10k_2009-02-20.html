the Performance Shares are subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11 hereof and Section&nbsp;11(c) of the Plan. In the event of a Change in Control, you will become legally entitled to have the grant of Performance Shares specified

set forth on the cover page hereof. If, before the stated vesting date, there occurs an event immediately after which you are not an employee of the Company, its subsidiaries or an affiliate of the Company, you will become vested in Performance
Shares only to the extent provided in Section&nbsp;6 or 8, and any Performance Shares that have not been earned and vested at or before such event and which cannot thereafter be earned and vested under Sections 6 or 8 shall be canceled and

you will be entitled to vesting of a &#147;Pro Rata Portion&#148; of the Performance Shares earned or deemed earned hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a termination of employment, the Pro Rata Portion is calculated as the
number of Performance Shares relating to a given Performance Year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months you were employed from the commencement of that Performance Year through the end of the month in which your
termination of employment occurred (but not more than 12) and the denominator of which is 12; provided, however, that the number of months you were employed shall be reduced by the number of months during such Performance Year in which you were
Disabled in excess of 26 weeks since the commencement of the Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a Disability extending longer than 26 weeks, the Pro Rata Portion is calculated as the number of Performance Shares relating to a
given Performance Year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is 12 minus the number of months you were Disabled in excess of 26 weeks since the commencement of the Disability, and the denominator of which is 12. For purposes of
calculations under this paragraph: (a)&nbsp;one or more days worked in a given month is counted as a full month of employment; and (b)&nbsp;one or more days on Disability in a given month in which the duration of Disability has not yet exceeded 26
weeks is also counted as a full month of employment. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The number of Performance Shares earned or vested shall be rounded to the nearest

SIZE="2">Performance Shares that become vested while you remain employed by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate shall be settled promptly upon vesting by delivery of one Share for each Performance Share being settled, unless validly deferred in
accordance with deferral terms then authorized by the Committee (subject to Plan Section&nbsp;11(k)). Performance Shares that become vested under Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) or 8 shall be settled at the times specified therein; provided, however, that
settlement of Performance Shares under Section&nbsp;6(a), (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Plan Section&nbsp;11(k). (<I>Note: Section&nbsp;11(k) could apply if settlement is triggered by a Change in Control or a
termination following a Change in Control</I>). Until Shares are delivered to you in settlement of Performance Shares, you shall have none of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Shares issuable in settlement of the
Performance Shares, including the right to vote the shares and receive dividends and other distributions. Shares of stock issuable in settlement of Performance Shares shall be delivered to you upon settlement in certificated form or in such other
