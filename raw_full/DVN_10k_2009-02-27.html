</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is effective &#091;INSERT
DATE&#093; (the &#147;<U>Effective Date</U>&#148;) by and between Devon Energy Corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;) and &#091;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#093; (the &#147;<U>Executive</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Executive currently serves as a senior executive officer of the Company pursuant
to an Employment Agreement with the Company dated &#091;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#093;;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement to amend, supersede, and fully
restate and replace the Employment Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Term of Agreement</U>. This Agreement shall not have any specific duration and shall
continue in full force and effect unless and until (i)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by
either party in accordance with Section&nbsp;3, and (ii)&nbsp;all obligations and liabilities of the parties
arising in connection with such termination or otherwise accruing under this Agreement have been
fully satisfied. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement constitutes a guarantee of continued employment but instead provides for certain rights
and benefits during the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company and if such employment terminates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Defined Terms</U>. Capitalized terms used throughout this Agreement have the meaning
ascribed to such terms in <U>Exhibit &#147;A&#148;</U> attached hereto.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Position and Duties</U>. The Executive shall serve as &#091;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#093; of the
Company or in such other substantially equivalent position(s) requested by the Board with the
appropriate authority, duties, and responsibilities attendant to such position(s). The Executive
shall devote his full working time, best efforts, abilities, knowledge, and experience to the
Company&#146;s business and affairs as necessary to faithfully perform his duties, responsibilities, and
authorities under this Agreement. The Executive may, without violating this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;serve
on corporate, civic, charitable, or industry boards or committees, (ii)&nbsp;deliver lectures, fulfill
speaking engagements, or teach at educational institutions, or (iii)&nbsp;manage personal investments,
so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the Executive&#146;s obligations under
this Agreement; <U>provided, however</U>, that the Executive shall not serve on the board of any
business, hold any other position with any business, or otherwise engage in any business activity,
without the prior written consent of his Supervisor. If the Executive conducted any such activities
as of the Effective Date, then the continuation of such activities (or similar activities for the
same organization) after the Effective Date shall be permitted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Annual Base Salary</U>. The Executive shall receive an Annual Base Salary, which may
be increased from time to time in the Company&#146;s discretion but shall not be reduced unless the
Company reduces the salaries of similarly situated executives, in which case the Annual Base Salary
may be reduced by the same percentage and shall be restored to its prior level when, and to the
same extent as, the Company restores the salaries of such similarly situated executives. Any
increase in Annual Base Salary shall not limit or reduce any other obligation owed to the Executive
under this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Annual Bonus</U>. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in a program in
which he may receive an Annual Bonus. If the Compensation Committee establishes a target for the
Annual Bonus as a percentage of the Annual Base Salary, then such target shall not be less than the
targets for similarly situated executives of the Company. Unless otherwise payable under Sections
4(b)(i)(B) or 4(c), the Executive must be actively employed for the entire year upon which the
Annual Bonus is based to be eligible to receive such Annual Bonus.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;<U>Incentive Awards</U>. In the Compensation Committee&#146;s discretion, the Company may
provide the Executive with annual equity grants, or cash awards in lieu of such grants, which shall
be comparable to the grants or awards made to similarly situated executives of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;<U>Disability</U>. The Company shall provide the same disability insurance coverage
benefits to the Executive as provided to similarly situated executives of the Company. If, during
his employment with the Company, the Executive receives Short-Term Disability Payments, then the
Company shall pay the Executive the difference between the Short-Term Disability Payments and the
portion of his then-current Annual Base Salary the Company would have paid him while receiving
Short-Term Disability Payments. If the Executive is Disabled during his employment with the
Company and otherwise entitled to receive salary and bonus payments under this Agreement, then any
such salary and bonus payments (or such payments in lieu of salary and bonus payments) shall be
reduced by the amount of any Short-Term Disability Payments received by the Executive for the
period of short-term disability and any benefits paid for the same period under the
Company-provided disability insurance coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;<U>Expenses</U>. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable
business-related expenses incurred and accounted for in accordance with its standard policies and
procedures for expense reimbursements and deductibles under Section&nbsp;162 of the Code.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;<U>Other Employee Benefits</U>. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall
be entitled to participate in all employee benefit, welfare, and other plans, practices, policies,
and programs applicable to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to the terms of
such plans, practices, policies, and programs as they may be amended from time to time. During any
CIC Period, the Company shall continue to provide the Executive (and the Executive&#146;s dependents, if
applicable) with the same level of health (including dental), disability, and life (including
accidental death/dismemberment) insurance benefits as were provided to the Executive (and the
Executive&#146;s dependents, if applicable) immediately before the Change in Control upon terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to the Executive than as in effect immediately
before the Change in Control with respect to each of such health, disability, and life insurance
coverages. Beginning on a Change in Control and continuing at all times thereafter, the Company
shall not modify the requirements for eligibility for coverage or the benefits under the Retiree
Medical Benefit Plan to adversely affect the Executive&#146;s right to coverage or benefits for the
Executive and the Executive&#146;s dependents, if applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;<U>Fringe Benefits</U>. To the extent not otherwise covered under this Agreement, the
Company shall provide the Executive with fringe benefits and perquisites to the same extent and on
the same terms as those benefits are provided by the Company from time to time to similarly
situated executives of the Company.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Reassignment</U>. Whether or not the Executive is Disabled, the Company may reassign
his duties during any time he has become physically or mentally incapable of performing his
essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation or job protection as required by
law and no such reassignment shall be deemed Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his
employment under Section&nbsp;3(d).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) <U>Termination</U>. If the Executive becomes Disabled, then the Company may give the
Executive written notice of its intent to terminate his employment, in which case such employment
shall terminate effective on the thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of such notice as long as the
Executive has not been medically released and returned to full-time duty before such thirtieth
(30th) day.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Termination by the Company; Cause</U>. The Company may terminate the Executive&#146;s
employment with the Company at any time whether with or without Cause. If the Company terminates
the Executive&#146;s employment for Cause, then such termination shall not be effective unless and until
the Board (i)&nbsp;provides reasonable notice and an opportunity to the Executive and his counsel (if
applicable) to be heard at a meeting called to discuss the Executive&#146;s employment and (ii)
subsequently provides the Executive with a copy of a resolution duly adopted by at least a
two-thirds (2/3) majority of the Board specifying that the Board has determined in good faith that
Cause exists for terminating the Executive&#146;s employment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;<U>Termination by the Executive; Good Reason</U>. The Executive may terminate his
employment with the Company at any time whether with or without Good Reason. If the Executive
believes Good Reason exists for terminating his employment, then he shall give the Company written
notice of the acts or omissions constituting Good Reason within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after learning of
such acts or omissions constituting Good Reason (the &#147;<U>Good Reason Notice</U>&#148;). No termination
of employment for Good Reason shall be effective unless (i)&nbsp;within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receiving
the Good Reason Notice, the Company fails to either cure such acts or omissions or notify the
Executive of the intended method of cure, and (ii)&nbsp;the Executive delivers a Notice of Termination
to the Company and subsequently resigns within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the Company&#146;s deadline in
Section&nbsp;3(d)(i) expires. Notwithstanding the previous sentence and at the Company&#146;s request, the
Executive shall provide services consistent with his then-current authority, duties, and
responsibilities for up to ninety (90)&nbsp;days after having provided the Good Reason Notice to the
Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;<U>Paid Suspensions</U>. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, the
Company may suspend the Executive with pay for up to thirty (30)&nbsp;days pending an investigation
authorized by the Company or the Board, or pursued by, or at the request of, a governmental
authority, to determine whether the Executive has engaged in acts or omissions constituting Cause.
Any such paid suspension shall not constitute Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his
employment under Section&nbsp;3(d). The Executive shall cooperate with the Company in connection with
any such investigation. If the Executive&#146;s employment is subsequently terminated for Cause in
connection with such investigation, then the Executive shall repay any amounts paid by the Company
to the Executive during such paid suspension.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Effect of a Change in Control on Timing of Termination Date</U>. If the Company
terminates the Executive&#146;s employment other than for Cause or the Executive becoming Disabled and a
Change in Control occurs following the Termination Date, then such Change in Control shall be
deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the Termination Date if either (i)&nbsp;the Termination
Date occurs following the execution of an agreement that provides for a transaction or transactions
that, if consummated, constitutes such Change in Control, or (ii)&nbsp;the Executive reasonably
demonstrates that such termination was either (A)&nbsp;requested by a third party who had indicated an
intention or taken steps reasonably

any. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company may relieve the Executive from further
duties under this Agreement after receiving a Notice of Termination; <U>provided, however</U>,
that prior to the Termination Date, the Executive shall continue to be treated as a Company
employee for other purposes and the Executive&#146;s rights to compensation or benefits shall not be

vacation through the Termination Date in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the

except as provided below, if any payment, benefit, or distribution by the Company, any Affiliate,
or trusts established by the Company or any Affiliate for the benefit of its employees, to or for
the benefit of the Executive (whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise but determined
without regard to any additional payments required under this Section&nbsp;7) (each, a
&#147;<U>Payment</U>&#148;) is determined to be subject to excise tax imposed by the Code, including Section
4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such
an excise tax (such excise tax and any such interest and penalties shall referred to as the
&#147;<U>Excise Tax</U>&#148;), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a
&#147;<U>Gross-Up Payment</U>&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes
(including any applicable interest or penalties) and Excise Tax imposed upon or related to the
Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains a Gross-Up Payment amount equal to the Excise Tax imposed
upon the Payments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Determinations and Tax Notice</U>. Subject to Section&nbsp;7(c), all determinations
required under this Section&nbsp;7, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and its
amount, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm designated and
paid by the Company (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;), which shall provide its analysis and detailed
supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days
after the Executive delivers to the Company any written notice of any claim by the Internal Revenue
Service that may require the Company&#146;s Gross-Up Payment (the &#147;<U>Tax Notice</U>&#148;). The Company
shall pay any Gross-Up Payment due under this Section&nbsp;7 to the Executive within five (5)&nbsp;days after
receiving the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination but in no event later than December&nbsp;31 of the year
next following the taxable year in which the Executive received the Payment. If the Accounting
Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, then it shall furnish the Executive
with an opinion supporting the determination not to report an Excise Tax on the Executive&#146;s federal
income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the parties. Due
to the uncertainty of the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code when the initial determination is
made by the Accounting Firm, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by
the Company should have been made (&#147;<U>Underpayment</U>&#148;), consistent with the calculations
required under this Section&nbsp;7. If the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 7(c) and
the Executive thereafter is required to pay any Excise Tax, then the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred, and any such Underpayment shall be
promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive but in no event later than the
December&nbsp;31 of the year next following the taxable year in which the Executive received the
Payment.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Devon Energy Corporation (the &#147;</B><U><B>Company</B></U><B>&#148;) is an equal opportunity employer. Various laws
prohibit employment discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age,
disability, eligibility for covered employee benefits, veteran status, and other legally protected
characteristics. You may also have rights under other federal, state, and/or municipal statutes,
orders, or regulations pertaining to labor, employment, and/or employee benefits. These laws are
enforced through the United States Department of Labor (DOL), the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), and various other federal, state, and municipal labor departments, fair
employment boards, human rights commissions, similar agencies, and courts.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>This General Release is being provided to you in connection with the Amended and Restated
Employment Agreement previously entered between you and the Company (the &#147;</B><U><B>Employment
Agreement</B></U><B>&#148;). You have at least twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days from the date you receive this General
Release, if you want it, to consider whether you wish to sign this General Release and receive the
payments and benefits (the &#147;</B><U><B>Severance Benefits</B></U><B>&#148;) available under the Employment Agreement
for doing so. You have at least until the close of business twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days from the date you
receive this General Release to make your decision. You may not, however, sign this General
Release until, at the earliest, your last effective date of employment.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>BEFORE SIGNING THIS GENERAL RELEASE YOU SHOULD REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. YOU ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO
CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY OF YOUR CHOICE.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>You may revoke this General Release within seven (7)&nbsp;days after you sign it and it shall not become
effective or enforceable until that revocation period has expired. If you do not timely sign and
return this General Release, or if you exercise your right to revoke the General Release after
signing it, then you will not be eligible to receive the Severance Benefits. Any revocation must
be in writing and must be received by the Company within the seven-day period following your
execution of this General Release.</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In consideration of the Severance Benefits offered to me by the Company under the Employment
Agreement, I hereby (i)&nbsp;release and discharge the Company and its predecessors, successors,
affiliates, parent, subsidiaries, and partners and each of those entities&#146; current and former
employees, officers, directors, and agents (together, the &#147;<U>Released Parties</U>&#148;) from all
claims, liabilities, demands, and causes of action, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, that I
may have or claim to have against them, including without limit any claims that result from or
arise out of my past employment with the Company, the severance of that relationship and/or
otherwise, or any contract or agreement with or relating to the Released Parties, and (ii)&nbsp;waive
any and all rights I may have with respect to and promise not to file a lawsuit to assert any such
claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This General Release includes, but is not limited to, claims arising under the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act (&#147;<U>ADEA</U>&#148;) and any other federal, state, and/or municipal statutes, orders,
or regulations pertaining to labor, employment, and/or employee benefits. This General Release
also applies without limitation to any claims or rights I may have growing out of any legal or
equitable restrictions on the rights of the Released Parties not to continue an employment
relationship with their employees, including any express or implied employment or other contracts,
and to any claims I may have against the Released Parties for fraudulent inducement or
misrepresentation, defamation, wrongful termination, or other torts or retaliation claims in
connection with workers&#146; compensation, any legally protected activity, or alleged whistleblower
status, or on any other basis whatsoever.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">It is specifically agreed, however, that this General Release does not have any effect on any
rights or claims under the ADEA I may have against the Company that arise after the date I execute
this General Release or on any vested rights I may have under any of the Company&#146;s qualified
benefit plans or arrangements as of or after my last day of employment with the Company or on any
of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Employment Agreement.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>MISCELLANEOUS</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">By signing this General Release, I shall, and hereby do, resign from any corporate, board, and
other offices and positions I may hold with the Company and its affiliates as of the date my
employment with the Company terminated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">I agree that (i)&nbsp;none of the Released Parties shall have any obligation to employ or to hire or
rehire me, to consider me for hire, or to deal with me in any respect with regard to potential
future employment; (ii)&nbsp;I shall not ever apply for or otherwise seek employment with any of the
Released Parties at any time in the future; and (iii)&nbsp;my forbearance to seek future employment as
just stated shall be construed as being purely contractual and in no way involuntary,
discriminatory, or retaliatory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">I have carefully reviewed and fully understand all the provisions of the Employment Agreement and
General Release, including the foregoing Notice. I have not relied on any representation or
statement, oral or written, relating to the Employment Agreement or this General Release by the
Released Parties that are not set forth in those documents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Employment Agreement and this General Release, including the foregoing Notice, set forth the
entire agreement between me and the Company with respect to payments and benefits payable to me due
to the termination of my employment with the Company, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, written and oral, between the parties with respect to such subject matters. I
understand that my receipt and retention of the Severance Benefits are contingent not only on my
execution and non-revocation of this General Release, but also on my continued compliance with my
other obligations under the Employment Agreement. I acknowledge that the Company has given me at
least twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days to consider whether I wish to accept or reject the Severance Benefits I
am otherwise eligible to receive under the Employment Agreement in exchange for signing and not
revoking this General Release. I hereby represent and state that I fully understand the effects
and consequences of the Employment Agreement and General Release prior to signing those documents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This General Release and the Company&#146;s obligation to provide the Severance Benefits under the
Employment Agreement shall be interpreted and construed to comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal
Revenue Code (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;). The parties agree to cooperate and work together in good faith
to take all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, I understand and acknowledge that I shall be solely
responsible for any risk that the tax treatment of all or part of the Severance Benefits may be
affected by Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and impose significant adverse tax consequences on me,
including accelerated taxation, a 20% additional tax, and interest. Because of the potential tax
consequences, I understand that I have the right, and am encouraged by this paragraph, to consult
with a tax advisor of my choice before signing this General Release.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This General Release shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oklahoma, without regard to any
conflict-of-laws principles, and shall not be modified unless in a writing signed by both of the
parties.
