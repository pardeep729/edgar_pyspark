Stock and Nonvoting Common Stock. If a Stock Dividend is declared or paid with respect to
one class, then a Stock Dividend shall likewise be declared or paid with respect to the
other class and shall consist of shares of such other class in a number that bears the same
relationship to the total number of shares of such other class, issued and outstanding

holders of Nonvoting Common Stock, except that the capital stock distributed to holders of
Common Stock may have full or any other voting rights and the capital stock distributed to
holders of Nonvoting Common Stock shall be non-voting to the same extent as the Nonvoting

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <B>Optional Redemption</B>. The Series&nbsp;E may not be redeemed by the Corporation prior to the
later of June&nbsp;1, 2012 and the date of original issue of Series&nbsp;E. On or after that date, the
Corporation, at its option, may redeem, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, the
shares of Series&nbsp;E at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at
a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, together (except as otherwise provided herein) with
an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date
(but with no amount in respect of any dividends that have not been declared prior to such date).
The redemption price for any shares of Series&nbsp;E shall be payable on the redemption date to the

Corporation or its agent. Any declared but unpaid dividends payable on a redemption date that
occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder
entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the

at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall
be at least 30&nbsp;days and not more than 60&nbsp;days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice
mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given,
whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or
any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series&nbsp;E designated
for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
shares of Series&nbsp;E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series&nbsp;E or any depositary shares
representing interests in the Series&nbsp;E are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust

less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be

manner as the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions
hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions
upon which shares of Series&nbsp;E shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares

the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three

hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions
upon which shares of Series&nbsp;F shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof.
