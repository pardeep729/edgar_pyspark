    <TD>An Employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan in accordance with its
terms on a Commencement Date shall automatically receive an option in accordance with
Section 8(a) and may become a Participant by completing and submitting, on or before
the date prescribed by the Committee with respect to a given Subscription Period, a
completed payroll deduction authorization and Plan enrollment form provided by Intel or
its Participating Subsidiaries or by following an electronic or other enrollment
process as prescribed by the Committee. An eligible Employee may authorize payroll
deductions at the rate of any whole percentage of the Employee&#146;s Compensation, not to
be less than two percent (2%) and not to exceed five percent (5%) of the Employee&#146;s
Compensation (or such other percentages as the Committee may establish from time to
time before a Commencement Date) of such Employee&#146;s Compensation on each payday during
the Subscription Period. All payroll deductions will be held in a general corporate
account or a trust account. No interest shall be paid or credited to the Participant
with respect to such payroll deductions. Intel shall maintain or cause to be maintained
a separate bookkeeping account for each Participant under the Plan and the amount of
each Participant&#146;s payroll deductions shall be credited to such account. A Participant
may not make any additional payments into such account, unless payroll deductions are
prohibited under Applicable Law, in which case the provisions of Section 5(b) of the
Plan shall apply.&#148;</TD>
