purpose of this Plan is to give each non-employee Director of Lockheed Martin Corporation the opportunity to be compensated for his or her service as a Director on a deferred basis. The Plan is also intended to establish a method of paying
Director&#146;s compensation which will aid the Corporation in attracting and retaining as members of the Board persons whose abilities, experience and judgment can contribute to the success of the Corporation. In addition, by providing Directors
with the option of accruing earnings based on the performance of Lockheed Martin Common Stock, the Plan is intended to more closely align the economic interests of Directors with the interests of stockholders generally. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Plan was amended and restated, effective January&nbsp;1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 409A. This
amendment and restatement of the Plan applies only to the portion of a Participant&#146;s Account Balance that is earned or becomes vested on or after January&nbsp;1, 2005 (and any earnings attributable to that portion). The portion of a
Participant&#146;s Account Balance that was earned and vested prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 (and any earnings attributable to that portion) shall be governed by the terms of the Plan in effect on December&nbsp;31, 2004, which is attached hereto as
Appendix A. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Plan and Appendix A were amended and restated, effective as soon as administratively practicable on or after
February&nbsp;1, 2009, to change the interest option for calculating earnings and to provide for new investment options in which Participants may invest their Account Balances, whether earned and vested before or after January&nbsp;1, 2005. The
addition of the new investment options in Appendix A is not intended to constitute a material modification within the meaning of Code section 409A. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

earned in any calendar year, a Director must make a deferral election by executing and filing an Election Form by December&nbsp;31 of the year prior to the year in which the fees will be earned. In the case of a new Director, an election to defer
Director&#146;s fees must be filed within 30 days after the commencement of the Director&#146;s term of office and shall apply only to fees for services after the date of such election. The deferral election shall specify the manner in which
earnings (or losses) on the deferred amount shall accrue in accordance with Section&nbsp;4.2 below. To the extent that a Director elects that any portion of a deferred amount shall accrue earnings (or losses) based on the Lockheed Martin Common
Stock Investment Option, such an election shall be given effect only if (i)&nbsp;the election is irrevocably made at least six (6)&nbsp;months prior to the effective date of the allocation or (ii)&nbsp;the crediting of the deferred amount to the
Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option has been approved by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof that is comprised of persons specified in Section&nbsp;6.1). To the extent that a Director makes an election to have Deferred
Compensation credited to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option which is not in compliance with (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;above, the amount elected to be deferred into the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option shall initially be
allocated to the Interest Option until such time as the allocation to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option would be in compliance with (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;above, at which time the deferred amount shall automatically be reallocated.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">3.2 <I>Terms of Deferral Elections</I>. A Director&#146;s deferral election for a calendar year shall specify the percentage (which may
equal 100%) of the Director&#146;s Fees to be earned by the Director for that year which are to be deferred under this Plan and, with respect to fees deferred pursuant to that election, the method for crediting earnings (or losses) selected by the
Director in accordance with Article IV and the manner of distribution in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.1(a). A Director&#146;s deferral election shall be irrevocable during any calendar year in which it is in effect. A Director&#146;s election
shall remain in effect and shall be deemed to have been made for a subsequent calendar year unless the Director files a revised election form by December&nbsp;31 of the year preceding the year in which the applicable Director&#146;s Fees will be
earned. If a Director files a change of election in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.1(c), the manner of distribution elected under that Section will apply only to the Deferred Compensation for the calendar years listed on the Election Form.
