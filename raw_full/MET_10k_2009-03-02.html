         This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of senior notes of the
Company issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture dated as of
November 9, 2001 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the Fifth
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 21, 2003 (the "Fifth Supplemental
Indenture," and together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), between
the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to
Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes
any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures incidental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of
the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes issued thereunder
and of the terms upon which said Senior Notes are, and are to be, authenticated
and delivered. This Senior Note is one of the series designated on the face
hereof as 5.875% Senior Notes due November 21, 2033 (the "Senior Notes"),
initially limited in aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 (or up to
$230,000,000 aggregate principal amount to the extent the Underwriters'
overallotment option pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing
Agreement is exercised); provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the
holders of the Senior Notes, on the same terms and with the same CUSIP number as
the Senior Notes. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is
provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.

         This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for
Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided
herein and in the Indenture. If (i) at any time the Depositary notifies the
Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note
or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good
standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other
applicable statute or regulation, and the Company does not appoint a successor
Depositary within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes
aware of such condition, as the case may be, or (ii) the Company in its sole
discretion determines that this Note shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes of
this series in definitive registered form and executes and delivers to the
Security Registrar a written order of the Company providing that this Note shall
be so exchangeable, this Note shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes of this
series in definitive registered form, provided that the definitive Senior Notes
so issued in exchange for this Note shall be in denominations of $25 and any
integral multiples, without coupons, and be of like aggregate principal amount
and tenor as the portion of this Note to be exchanged. Except as provided above,
owners of beneficial interests in this Note will not be entitled to have Senior
Notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to physical
delivery of Senior Notes in definitive registered form and will not be
considered the holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture. Neither the
Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent nor the Security Registrar shall have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in this Note, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests.

         If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable
in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at
any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not
less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the
time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders
of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance
by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver
by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and
upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether
or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

         The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the
entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (b) restrictive
covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with
certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.

         The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the option of the Company, in
whole at any time or in part from time to time, on or after November 21, 2008 at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to
be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed
to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

         Notwithstanding Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture, the notice of
redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the
Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

         The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with
respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The
Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price.

         If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee
shall select the Senior Notes or portions of the Senior Notes to be redeemed by
such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may select
for redemption Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $25 and
whole multiples of $25.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register,
upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency
of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security
Registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized
denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount,
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company
will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge payable in connection therewith.

         Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Security Registrar of the Company
or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is
registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this
Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon
made by anyone other than the Security Registrar, and neither the Company nor
the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security Registrar shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

         The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons
in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a
different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the
same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the
office or agency of the Company.

         No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on
this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or
based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder,
officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any
predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution,
statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or
otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the
consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

         Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit
under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

         This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the state of New York.
