Employees (as well as their spouses and beneficiaries) not be subject to the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and that the Plan be interpreted and administered in accordance with this intention. The provisions of the Plan shall not be

Equalization Profit-Sharing Allowance) of a TP Employee, in each case considered deferred before January&nbsp;1, 2005 (within the meaning of Final Regulation &#167;1.409A-6(a) (2)&nbsp;and other provisions of the Final Regulations). </FONT></P> <P

of Altria Group, Inc. determined to discontinue making target payments with respect to services performed after December&nbsp;31, 2007. Under the terms of the Plan, TP Employees generally are not eligible to participate for those years for which
they received a target payment after December&nbsp;31, 2004. It is intended that the benefits provided under the Plan will not duplicate amounts previously paid as current compensation under the terms of the Supplemental Enrollment Agreements.

elected to make to the Profit-Sharing Plan and (2)&nbsp;to provide that portion of the benefit that was awarded to the Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group, Inc. earned after December&nbsp;31, 2004 and that was formerly provided under the

shall be treated as a separate plan, program or arrangement from the other plans. One of the plans provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) solely in excess of the Section&nbsp;415 Limitations; the second plan
provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) attributable solely to the Compensation Limitation; the third plan provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) because payment of the
benefit from one or both of the Qualified Plans could result in a failure to meet the nondiscrimination requirements of Section&nbsp;401(a)(4) of the Code or the coverage requirements of Section&nbsp;410(b) of the Code; and the fourth plan provides
benefits to a TP Employee who is resuming active participation in the Plan, effective January&nbsp;1, 2008. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the provisions of this Plan, (1)&nbsp;no amounts shall be deemed credited or accrued under the Plan after December&nbsp;31, 2004 to the extent the Administrator determines that the accrual, crediting or payment of such amounts under
the terms of the Plan or related arrangements would risk subjecting Plan participants to taxation or penalties under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, and (2)&nbsp;the Plan terms applicable to any amounts determined by the Administrator to be deferred
compensation subject to the requirements of such Section&nbsp;409A may be modified by the Administrator to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with such requirements. The Administrator may take any such action with
