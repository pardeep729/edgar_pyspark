</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>I. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">1.1 <U>Purpose</U>. The purpose of this Schering-Plough Corporation 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) is to enable Schering-Plough Corporation to achieve superior financial performance, as
reflected in the performance of its Shares and other key financial or operating indicators by (i)
providing incentives and rewards to certain Employees who are in a position to contribute
materially to the success and long-term objectives of Schering-Plough, (ii)&nbsp;aiding in the
recruitment and retention of Employees of outstanding ability and (iii)&nbsp;providing Employees an
opportunity to acquire or expand equity interests in Schering-Plough, thus aligning the interests
of such Employees with those of Schering-Plough&#146;s shareholders. Schering-Plough expects that it
will benefit from the added interest that such Employees will have in the welfare of
Schering-Plough as a result of their ownership or increased ownership of Schering-Plough&#146;s Shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">1.2 <U>Effective Date; Shareholder Approval</U>. The Plan was originally effective as of May&nbsp;19,
2006, subject to the approval of the Plan by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the Shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the 2006 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of Schering-Plough, or any adjournment of such meeting. Any Awards granted under the
Plan prior to the approval of the Plan by Schering-Plough&#146;s shareholders, as provided herein, were
contingent on such approval; if such approval is not obtained, the Plan would have had no effect,
and any Awards granted under the Plan would have been rescinded. Schering-Plough&#146;s shareholder
approved the Plan at the 2006 Annual Meeting and the Plan became effective on May&nbsp;19, 2006.

If any provision or this Plan or of any grant of an Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict

the grant, exercise, transfer or payment would violate the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 or any other applicable law. In addition, it is the intent of Schering-Plough that the Plan
and applicable Awards under the Plan comply with the applicable provisions of Sections 162(m) and
422 of the Code, and to the extent an Award is subject to the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the

compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation.
