<p align="left"><strong>GENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC</strong> - General merchandise traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:&nbsp;&nbsp;automotive; chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest products.&nbsp;&nbsp;The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai,  Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal wastes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The metals and construction group includes steel, aluminium products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks, and minerals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper, clay and forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.</p>
<p align="left">In 2011, 120 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 66% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.&nbsp;&nbsp;General merchandise carloads handled in 2011 were 2.3 million, the revenues from which accounted for 50% of NS&rsquo; total railway operating revenues in 2011.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>INTERMODAL TRAFFIC</strong> - The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer&reg; equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermodal units handled in 2011 were<br>3.2 million, the revenues from which accounted for 19% of NS&rsquo; total railway operating revenues for the year.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>FREIGHT RATES</strong> - In 2011, NS&rsquo; railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a major portion of NS&rsquo; freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices.</p>
<p align="left">In 2011, NS&rsquo; railroads were found by the STB to not be &ldquo;revenue adequate&rdquo; based on results for the year 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;A railroad is &ldquo;revenue adequate&rdquo; on an annual basis  under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry&rsquo;s composite cost of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.</p>

<p>Capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2012, NS has budgeted $2.4 billion of property additions.</p>

<p>NS has invested and will continue to invest in various projects and corridor initiatives to expand its rail network to increase capacity and improve transit times, while returning value to shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiatives include the following:


<ul>
<li>The MidAmerica Corridor is an arrangement between NS and Canadian National Railway (CN) to share track between Chicago, St. Louis, Kentucky, and Mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the Midwest and Southeast, including potential coal traffic moving to NS-served southeastern utility plants from CN-served Illinois Basin coal producers.</li>
<li>Pan Am Southern LLC, a joint venture between NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc., is a 155-mile main line track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer, Massachusetts, along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including trackage rights in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont designed to increase intermodal and automotive capacity.</li>

</ul>





  <p align="center">K7

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<ul>
<li>The Crescent Corridor consists of a planned program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20,<br>I-40, I-59, I-78, and I-75.</li>
<li>The Heartland Corridor, which opened in 2010, is a package of clearance improvements and other facilities that created a seamless high-capacity intermodal route across Virginia and West Virginia to Midwest markets.</li>
<li>Meridian Speedway LLC, a joint venture between NS and Kansas City Southern, is a 320-mile rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana designed to increase capacity and improve service.</li>
<li>The CREATE project is a public-private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS and other railroads have agreed to participate in CREATE.</li>

<p align="left">More than 80% of NS&rsquo; railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of &ldquo;Labor Agreements&rdquo; in Part II, Item 7, &ldquo;Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>GOVERNMENT REGULATION</strong> - In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, NS&rsquo; railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Railroad Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.</p>

<p align="left">The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well  for the duration of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 86% of NS&rsquo; freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.</p>
<p align="left">Efforts were made in 2011 to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.</p>



<p align="center">K10

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left"><strong>COMPETITION</strong> - There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.</p>

<p align="left">NS&rsquo; primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the same territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage,  sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.</p>
<p align="left">Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>SECURITY OF OPERATIONS</strong> - NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the NS rail system.<br>
In particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents, the NS Departmental Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;All NS Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.</p>
<p align="left">The NS plan also effectively addresses and complies with Department of Transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward that end, NS, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed a four-module uniform national training program.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also has worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by NS.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

<p align="left">Additionally, NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;As one notable example, an NS Police Special Agent in Charge (SAC), under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operated by the FBI, and located at the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) in Arlington, VA to represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while having the post filled by an NS SAC has also served to foster a strong working relationship between NS and the FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.&nbsp;&nbsp;C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.</p>



<p align="center">K11

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left">Similarly, NS is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by DHS and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security requirements, as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads. Many of the action items are based on lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify, through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.&nbsp;&nbsp;These action items and NS&rsquo; compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the NS Departmental Security Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the TSA Final Security Rule addressing Rail Security Sensitive Materials (RSSM) to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chain-of-custody is maintained when required.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS is in compliance with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS conducts annual, on-going route evaluations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, this methodology and selected routes were reviewed by the Federal Railroad Administration, and found to be compliant with the regulation as part of the annual review conducted by FRA.</p>

<p align="left">In 2011, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response training to approximately 5,316 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, representing over 18,986 hours of emergency response training.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also conducted railroad operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from NJTTF.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; other training efforts throughout 2011 included participation in 17 drills for local, state, and federal agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course (SERTC) conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.</p>
<p align="left">Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.&nbsp;&nbsp;PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA, is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim design standards for railroad tank cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Item1A" id="Item1A"></a></p>
<p align="left"><strong><u>Item 1A. Risk Factors</u></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>NS is subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by Congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the STB, which has jurisdiction over some routes, rates and fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB also has jurisdiction over consolidations, mergers, or acquisitions involving rail common carriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on NS&rsquo; ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on NS&rsquo; rail network or abandonment of lines.</p>
<p align="left">Railroads are subject to safety and security regulation by the DOT and the DHS, which regulate most aspects of NS&rsquo; operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.</p>

<p align="left">NS&rsquo; operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or ground water supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of incurring environmental liability - for acts and omissions, past, present, and future - is inherent in the railroad business.&nbsp;&nbsp;This risk includes property owned by NS, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including NS railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or past and present tenants of NS.</p>

<p align="center">K12

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">
<p align="left">Environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and NS could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>NS, as a common carrier by rail, must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.</strong> Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>NS may be affected by terrorism or war.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect NS&rsquo; results of operations, financial position, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because NS plays a critical role in the nation&rsquo;s transportation system, it could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government&rsquo;s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.</p>
<p align="left">Although NS currently maintains insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, it maintains only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in NS&rsquo; care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, premiums for some or all of NS&rsquo; current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to NS in the future.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>NS may be affected by general economic conditions.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities NS carries may have an adverse effect on its operating results, financial position, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>NS may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to GHG&rsquo;s could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase NS&rsquo; operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves owned by NS, and thus could have an adverse effect on NS&rsquo; operating results, financial position and liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such restrictions could affect NS&rsquo; customers that (1) use commodities that NS carries to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities NS carries, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>NS faces competition from other transportation providers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;NS is subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads, and to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and the quality and reliability of service.&nbsp;&nbsp;While NS has used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which NS operates, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>The operations of carriers with which NS interchanges may adversely affect its operations.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by connecting carriers, or in NS&rsquo; relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in NS&rsquo; inability to meet its customers&rsquo; demands or require NS to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.</p>


<p align="center">K13

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">



<p align="left"><strong>NS relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If NS experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more of its information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, NS could experience a service interruption, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if NS does not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or it is  unable to implement new technology, NS may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>The vast majority of NS employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 80% of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, NS could experience a significant disruption of its operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase NS&rsquo; costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>NS may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of NS&rsquo; business exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer&rsquo;s Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA&rsquo;s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker&rsquo;s compensation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.</p>

<p align="left">Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on NS&rsquo; operating results, financial condition, and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specified levels of risk are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently up to $50 million and above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties  and up to $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for property owned by NS or in its care, custody, or control).&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to NS.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect NS&rsquo; operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Workforce demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on NS&rsquo; ability to meet demand for rail service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on NS&rsquo; operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>NS may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its supplier markets.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;NS consumed about 475 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors, NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be materially adversely affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, such an event would impact NS as well as its customers and other transportation companies.</p>

<p align="center">K14

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">




<p align="left">Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, NS competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or material shortages of materials that could have a material affect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>The state of capital markets could adversely affect NS&rsquo; liquidity.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;NS from time-to-time relies on the capital markets to provide some of its capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of NS&rsquo; financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate NS&rsquo; access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of NS&rsquo; financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in NS&rsquo; credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict NS from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><u>Item 3. Legal Proceedings</u></strong></p>
<p align="left">On June 25, 2010, the Ohio Attorney General filed a complaint in the Ashtabula Court of Common Pleas alleging certain violations of water laws by NS&rsquo; coal dock in Ashtabula, Ohio and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint was filed simultaneously with a Consent Order for Preliminary Injunction that governs the installation of additional pollution control equipment at the dock.&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter relates to previously disclosed enforcement activity initiated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in early 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;A final Consent Order was entered by the court on August 11, 2011 and a penalty in excess of $100,000 was paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of this proceeding did not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>
<p align="left">On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against NS and other Class 1 railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS believes the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawsuit containing similar allegations against NS and four other major railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.</p>






<p align="left">NS previously had outstanding two Notices of Probable Violation (NPV) issued by the PHMSA in connection with the 5.5-mile locomotive fuel pipeline serving the railroad&rsquo;s Brosnan Yard in Macon, Georgia.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPVs were settled by NS&rsquo; payment of penalties exceeding $100,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution of these claims did not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on December 13, 2010, NS made voluntary disclosures to PHMSA regarding potential violations relative to a 5.5-mile pipeline in Goldsboro, North Carolina, that is owned by a wholly owned subsidiary and that supplies jet fuel to the United States Air Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;No further penalties are expected at this time as NS in mid-2011 retained the services of a nationally recognized pipeline operator to operate its Macon Pipeline and the Airforce pipeline.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries<br />
  Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of<br />
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations</strong> </p>
<p align="left">The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong> </p>
<p align="left"> With global and domestic economies reflecting pent-up demand, NS&rsquo; net income grew for the second consecutive year.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo;  2011 net income rose 28% as a result of a 20% increase in income from railway operations and a lower effective income tax rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating revenues increased 17% as a result of higher average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharges) and increased traffic volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating expenses increased 16%, reflecting  higher fuel prices and increased traffic volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;The railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) improved to 71.2%, as compared with 71.9% in 2010. </p>
<p align="left">Cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.2 billion which, along with cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings allowed for property additions, share repurchases, debt repayments, and dividend payments. During 2011, 30.2 million shares of Common Stock were repurchased at a total cost of $2.1 billion. Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 109.6 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $6.2 billion. At December 31, 2011, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $301 million.</p>
<p align="left">Looking forward to 2012, NS expects revenues to increase, reflecting higher traffic volumes but at a more moderate pace than seen in 2011 given the slow-growing economy, and higher average revenue per unit that will meet or slightly exceed the rate of rail inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS plans to continue to focus on safety,  improving service levels and operational efficiency, and maintaining a market-based approach to pricing. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</strong> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>2011 Compared with 2010</strong> </p>
<p align="left">Net income in 2011 was $1.9 billion, or $5.45 per diluted share, up $420 million, or 28%, compared with $1.5 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share, in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations and a lower effective tax rate (see Note 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating revenues increased $1.7 billion, reflecting higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges, and higher traffic volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating expenses increased<br>$1.1 billion, principally due to higher fuel prices and volume-related expenses. </p>
<p align="left">Oil prices affect NS&rsquo; results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect NS&rsquo; revenues through market-based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see &ldquo;Railway Operating Revenues&rdquo;) and also affect fuel costs (see &ldquo;Railway Operating Expenses&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2011, excluding the impact of increased consumption, the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the increase in fuel expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>2010 Compared with 2009</strong> </p>
<p align="left">Net income in 2010 was $1.5 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share, up $462 million, or 45%, compared with $1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes (see Note 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, reflecting higher traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Railway operating expenses increased $833 million, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and fuel prices. </p>

<p align="left">Two of NS&rsquo; customers, DuPont and South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA), filed  rate reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS  disputes these allegations, however, in August 2011, NS agreed to settle the rate reasonableness complaint with SMEPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement of this claim did not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since  June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, NS has been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management presently expects resolution of the DuPont case  to occur in  2013 and believes the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to rate cases, management records adjustments to revenues in the periods, if and when, such adjustments are probable and estimable.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>COAL</strong> revenues increased $739 million, or 27%, compared with 2010, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume  principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal average revenue per unit was up 22%,  reflecting improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue.</p>

<p align="left">In 2010, coal revenues increased $455 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 10% increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal average revenue per unit was up 9% compared with 2009, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved pricing. </p>

<p align="left">For 2012, coal revenues are expected to increase due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing improvement, in addition to increased volumes as a result of more shipments of export coal. </p>
<p align="left">Coal represented 31% of NS&rsquo; revenues in 2011 and 80% of shipments handled originated on NS&rsquo; lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in the following table, tonnage increased in three of the four coal markets. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Utility coal</strong> tonnage improved a modest 1% in 2011, primarily a result of new business and the resumption in the first quarter of shipments to electrical generation units that had been idled since the first quarter of 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases were tempered by the effects of increased natural gas generation due to low natural gas prices, reduced electrical demand in NS served regions, and severe weather disruptions in 2011. </p>



<p align="center">K21

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">



<p align="left">In 2010, utility coal tonnage improved slightly as residential demand increased due to severe winter weather and above average summer temperatures on the East Coast. Additionally, electricity demand in the industrial sector was higher. These increases more than offset the effects of low natural gas prices and the diversion of utility coal to the export market.</p>

<p align="left">For 2012, we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease, as new business gains will be more than offset by the effects of reduced electricity demand as a result of very mild winter weather conditions and  low natural gas prices. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Export coal</strong> tonnage increased 25% compared to 2010, reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production and tightened supply from Australia due to  flooding in the first half of 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up 4.7 million tons, or 30%, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased 0.8 million tons, or 11%. </p>

<p align="left">In 2010, export coal tonnage increased 27% compared with 2009, reflecting increased  global demand  for coal used in steel production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up 1.3 million tons, or 9%, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased 3.5 million tons, or 97%. </p>
<p align="left">For 2012, export coal tonnage is expected to increase due to port capacity improvement projects, new coal production driven by planned mine expansions and worldwide demand, and new steam coal opportunities to Europe and  Asia. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Domestic metallurgical coal</strong> tonnage was  flat in 2011 compared with 2010. </p>
<p align="left">In 2010, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage increased 67% compared with 2009, as domestic steel production improved due to an increase in steel demand as blast furnaces resumed operations. </p>
<p align="left">For 2012, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decrease as greater coking coal availability in the second half of 2011 led to inventory replenishment in late 2011 and anticipated lesser 2012 demand for domestic metallurgical coal. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Industrial coal</strong> tonnage increased 2% in 2011, compared with 2010, as new business completely offset the impact of tight coal supply and network delays experienced in the early part of the year.</p>
<p align="left">In 2010, industrial coal tonnage  increased 1% compared to 2009, primarily due to new business and increased demand in the steel market. </p>
<p align="left">For 2012, new business is expected to drive increases in industrial coal tonnage. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>GENERAL MERCHANDISE</strong> revenues in 2011 increased $583 million, or 12%, compared with 2010, reflecting an<br>
  11% rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, traffic volume was relatively flat. </p>

<p align="left">In 2010, general merchandise revenues increased $826 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting a 14% increase in traffic volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and  higher rates. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Agriculture, consumer products, and government</strong> revenues increased 9% in 2011, compared with 2010, the result of 14% higher average revenue per unit,&nbsp;which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic volume declined 5% as a result of fewer shipments of fertilizer due to certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of corn to the Midwest due to the impact of a healthier Midwest crop. </p>
<p align="left">In 2010, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 12%, compared with 2009, due to an 11% increase in traffic volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in traffic volume was a result of:&nbsp;&nbsp;more shipments of sweeteners and corn due to  continued strength in the demand for ethanol; higher fertilizer volumes due to farmers replenishing nutrients to meet increased crop demand; and increased feed volumes due to a strong export market.</p>

<p align="left">For 2012, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit, reflecting projected growth driven by gains in the ethanol market in addition to more feed product and corn shipments due to slightly improved demand for animal feed. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Chemicals </strong>revenues in 2011 increased 5%, compared with 2010, as a 14% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharges more than offset the effects of an 8% decrease in traffic volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in volume was primarily a result of reduced shipments of fly ash due to the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority ash project in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>

<p align="left">In 2010, chemicals revenue increased 23%, compared with 2009, due to an 18% increase in traffic volume and a 5% growth in average revenue per unit, reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume gains reflected new business of fly ash in addition to higher shipments of petroleum, industrial intermediates, plastics, and miscellaneous chemicals resulting from improvements in the economy.</p>

<p align="left">For 2012, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of higher shipments of crude oil from the Midwest destined for eastern refineries and more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas as a previously idled refinery restarts. Improvements in the economy are also expected to generate higher plastic volumes. Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Metals and construction</strong> revenues increased 23% in 2011, compared with 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue improvement resulted from   16% higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic volume improved 6% reflecting increased automotive production that led to more shipments of coil steel, and more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling.</p>
<p align="left">In 2010, metals and construction revenues increased 36%, reflecting a 25% increase in traffic volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in traffic volume was principally due to more shipments of coil, iron and steel, and scrap metal due to increased steel and automotive production, as well as higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling.</p>
<p align="left">For 2012, metals and construction revenues are expected to be modestly higher reflecting continued growth in the natural gas drilling sector and higher metal-related traffic volumes due to increased domestic and global steel production. Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Automotive revenues</strong> rose 20%, compared to 2010, reflecting a 14% increase in traffic volume due to increased domestic production of North American light vehicles and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges.</p>
<p align="left">In 2010, automotive revenues rose 23%, compared to 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;A network redesign that eliminated reloadings at mixing centers resulted in fewer carloads and higher revenue per unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 33,200 carloads were eliminated in 2010 as a result of the design changes in the automotive network.&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction in carloadings was completely offset by higher volumes associated with the 40% increase in production of North American light vehicles.</p>
<p align="left">For 2012, automotive revenues are expected to modestly increase as a result of volume gains driven by an increase in domestic production of North American light vehicles at plants served by NS, in addition to  higher average revenue per unit related to rate increases from escalators and contract renegotiations.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Paper, clay and forest products</strong> revenues increased 6% in 2011, compared with 2010, reflecting an 11% improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates and higher fuel surcharges, which more than offset the effects of the 4% traffic volume decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in volume was principally due to fewer shipments of wood chips as dryer weather in the Southeast prompted customer sourcing changes, in addition to the closure of a plant in the third quarter of 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced shipments of kaolin and newsprint associated with lower demand and the loss of some lower-rated business also impacted the year.</p>
<p align="left">In 2010, paper, clay, and forest products revenues increased 7%, compared with 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement resulted from a 7% increase in traffic volumes, a reflection of increased pulp board, pulp,  kaolin, lumber, and newsprint shipments as a result of improvements in the domestic and global economies. </p>

<p align="left">For 2012, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are expected to be slightly higher as increased average revenue per unit is expected to be partially offset by reduced volumes as demand stays soft.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>INTERMODAL</strong> revenues increased $334 million, or 19%, compared with 2010, reflecting a 10% increase in traffic volume and an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit as a result of higher fuel surcharges and increased rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, all intermodal segments experienced volume increases, reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as tight truck capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic volume (which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies&rsquo;
volumes) increased 15%; international traffic volume improved 5%; premium business, which includes parcel and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, increased 9%; and Triple Crown Services (Triple Crown), a service with rail-to-highway trailers, experienced a 1% growth in volume. </p>

<p align="left">The increase in 2011 reflected the unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and higher costs associated with locomotive and railcar materials,  taxes (primarily sales and use, property, and excise), and employee travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase for 2011 also reflected less favorable personal injury claims development and higher supply costs.</p>

<p align="left">The increase in 2010 reflected increased locomotive and roadway materials expenses, reduced level of favorable personal injury claims development, the absence of the  $21 million favorable settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute that benefited 2009, and higher costs associated with supplies, employee travel, derailments, environmental remediation, and property taxes.</p>



  <p align="left">The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS&rsquo; insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million)  of the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge during the first quarter of 2011 for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 2010, NS settled an arbitration claim ($100 million) with another insurance carrier with no adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">
<p align="left">The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 44% of total employee injury cases resolved and about 31% of total employee injury payments made.&nbsp;&nbsp;With its long-established commitment to safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers&rsquo; Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.&nbsp;&nbsp;FELA&rsquo;s fault-based system, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers&rsquo; compensation system. </p>

<p align="left">NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third-party liability and property damage claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self-insurance (see Note 16). </p>










<p align="left"><strong>Purchased services and rents</strong> includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This category of expenses increased $133 million, or 9%, in 2011  and increased $74 million, or 5%, in 2010. </p>

<p align="left">Purchased services costs were $1.3 billion in 2011, $1.2 billion in 2010, and $1.1 billion in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally driven by higher costs associated with higher volumes.</p>
<p align="left">Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, amounted to $338 million, $326 million, and<br>$316 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally due to higher traffic volumes. </p>


<p align="left"><strong>Depreciation</strong> expense increased $43 million, or 5%, in 2011, but decreased $18 million, or 2%, in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in 2011 reflects NS&rsquo; larger roadway and equipment capital base as NS continues to invest in its infrastructure.</p>
<p align="left">The decrease in 2010 reflected lower depreciation rates that resulted from an equipment study that was completed in the first quarter of 2010 which more than offset the effects of NS&rsquo; larger roadway and equipment capital base.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Other Income &#8211; Net</strong> </p>
<p align="left">Other income &#8211; net was $160 million in 2011, $153 million in 2010, and $127 million in 2009 (see Note 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in 2011 reflected reduced interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions (down $9 million), higher net corporate-owned life insurance returns (up $7 million), and increased coal royalties (up $6 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases were offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property (down $9 million) and increased professional and legal fees associated with the third quarter debt exchange and the fourth quarter credit facility renewal (up $7 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The increase in 2010 reflected higher gains on the sale of property, including a $35 million gain on the sale of land to the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia and a $13 million favorable coal royalty settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases were offset in part by increased interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions and other tax contingencies (which includes the absence of 2009 favorable resolution of prior years&rsquo; tax matters).</p>




<p align="left"><strong>Income Taxes</strong> </p>
<p align="left">Income tax expense in 2011 was $1 billion, for an effective rate of 34%, compared with effective rates of 37% in 2010 and 36% in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in the rate for 2011 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an IRS examination of NS&rsquo; 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund ($40 million), a decrease in deferred tax expense for state tax law changes ($28 million),  and the absence of a first quarter 2010 charge to deferred tax expense ($27 million) due to a change in the tax law impacting the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.&nbsp;&nbsp;These decreases were offset in part by the absence of a fourth quarter 2010 $34 million benefit resulting from a change in estimate related to NS&rsquo; deferred taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate for 2010 was primarily due to the Medicare-related charge, a lower benefit from Conrail equity, and an increase in state taxes, offset in part by the $34 million deferred tax benefit mentioned above.</p>

<p align="left">Fifty-percent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 through 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period September 2010 through the end of 2011 and allows 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonus depreciation does not affect  NS&rsquo; total provision for income taxes or effective tax rate, but does significantly lower current tax expense and the related cash outflows for income taxes paid.</p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; consolidated income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 are undergoing routine audit by the IRS.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</strong> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Cash provided by operating activities,</strong> NS&rsquo; principal source of liquidity, was $3.2 billion in 2011 compared with<br>$2.7 billion in 2010 and $1.9 billion in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in 2011 reflects better operating results and lower income taxes paid due to additional bonus depreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in 2010 reflected  improved operating results, in addition to a reduction in working capital components.&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating cash flows in 2010 also benefited from the favorable settlement of an insurance claim related to the 2005 Graniteville derailment. NS had working capital of $50 million at December 31, 2011, compared with working capital  of $389 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting a lower cash balance offset in part by lower current maturities of long-term debt as no senior notes will mature in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances totaled $301 million and $1.1 billion  at  December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was invested in accordance with NS&rsquo; corporate investment policy as approved by the Board of Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no limits or restrictions on NS&rsquo; access to these assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS expects that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations.</p>
<p align="left">Contractual obligations at December 31, 2011, comprised of NS&rsquo; long-term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC and long-term advances from Conrail (see Note 5), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 16), and unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 3), were as follows: </p>

<p align="left">The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20, I-40, I-59, I-78, and<br>
I-75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, NS plans to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor through a series of public-private partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $267 million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the state of Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS currently estimates spending up to $360 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects, which is expected in 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;Planned 2012 investments for the Crescent Corridor approximate $128 million.</p>




<p align="left"><strong>Cash used in financing activities</strong> was $2.0 billion in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion in 2010, and $31 million in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in 2011 primarily reflects increased share repurchases, offset in part by higher proceeds from borrowing, net of debt repayments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in 2010 reflected the resumed repurchase and retirement of Common Stock as part of NS&rsquo; share repurchase program, in addition to lower borrowings, net of debt repayments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Share repurchases totaled $2.1 billion in 2011, $863 million in 2010, and zero in 2009 for the purchase and retirement of 30.2 million, 14.7 million, and zero shares, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by management&rsquo;s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2011, NS had remaining authority from its Board of Directors to repurchase 15.4 million shares through<br>December 31, 2014.</p>
<p align="left">During the fourth quarter of 2011, NS issued $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due 2021 and an additional<br>$100 million of 6% senior notes due 2111.</p>

<p align="left">During the third quarter of 2011, NS issued $600 million of unsecured notes ($596 million at 4.837% due 2041 and<br>
$4 million at 6% due 2111) and paid $146 million of premium in exchange for $526 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($422 million at 7.05% due 2037, $77 million at 7.9% due 2097, and $27 million at 7.25% due 2031).&nbsp;&nbsp;The premium is reflected as a reduction of debt in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the debt exchange.</p>

<p align="left">During the second quarter of 2011, NS issued an additional $400 million of 6% senior notes due 2111.</p>

<p align="left">NS&rsquo;  debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 43.2% at December 31, 2011, compared with 39.7% at December 31, 2010.</p>

<p align="left">As of December 31, 2011, NS has authority from its Board of Directors to issue an additional $1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form S-3 automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority.</p>

<p align="left">In December 2011, NS renewed and amended its five-year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The renewed and amended five-year agreement, which expires in 2016, reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from $1 billion to $750 million to more closely match NS&rsquo; liquidity requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS had no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011, and NS is in compliance with all of its covenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2011, NS renewed  its $350 million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364-day term to run until October 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $200 million outstanding under this program at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (see Note 8).</p>




<p align="left">Looking forward, NS&rsquo; annual debt maturities are relatively modest (see Note 8).&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, NS&rsquo; goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS&rsquo; business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES</strong></p>
<p align="left">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&nbsp;&nbsp;These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management regularly discusses the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits</strong></p>
<p align="left">Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11).&nbsp;&nbsp;These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans&rsquo; assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management makes these estimates based on the company&rsquo;s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).&nbsp;&nbsp;Management utilizes an independent actuarial consulting firm&rsquo;s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.</p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; net pension expense, which is included in &ldquo;Compensation and benefits&rdquo; in its Consolidated Statements of Income, was $50 million for 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;In recording this amount, NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.75%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception.&nbsp;&nbsp;A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million change in pension expense, and, as a result, an equal change in &ldquo;Compensation and benefits&rdquo; expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS&rsquo; net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;The net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS utilizes  analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS uses the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.</p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in &ldquo;Compensation and benefits,&rdquo; was $101 million for 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in &ldquo;Other postretirement benefits,&rdquo; management estimated future increases in health-care costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Properties and Depreciation</strong></p>
<p align="left">Most of NS&rsquo; total assets are long-lived railway properties (see Note 6).&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in Note 1, NS&rsquo; properties are depreciated using group depreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary depreciation method for NS&rsquo; asset base is group life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.</p>





<p align="left">NS&rsquo; depreciation expense is based on management&rsquo;s assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing these assumptions, NS&rsquo; management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the STB.</p>

<p align="center">K30

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p>Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;</li>
  <li>review of historical salvage received and current market rates;</li>
  <li>review of NS&rsquo; operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;</li>
  <li>review of accounting policies and assumptions; and</li>
  <li>industry review and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.</p>
<p>NS&rsquo; recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; depreciation expense for 2011 amounted to $862 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; composite depreciation rates for 2011 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $32 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2011, roadway       depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 33.3% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.32% to 37.84%.</p>

<p align="left">When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;When retiring rail, ties, and ballast, NS uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in &ldquo;Other income &#8211; net&rdquo; (see Note 2) since such income is not a product of NS&rsquo; railroad operations.</p>
<p>A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in earnings, however, there were no such gains or losses in 2011, 2010, or 2009.</p>
<p>NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value.</p>





<p align="left"><strong>Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities</strong></p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; expense for casualties and other claims, included in &ldquo;Materials and other,&rdquo; amounted to $216 million in 2011. Typically, most of this expense relates to NS&rsquo; accrual for personal injury liabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.&nbsp;&nbsp;FELA&rsquo;s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker&rsquo;s compensation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.</p>

<p align="center">K31

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left">To aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, NS utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS&rsquo; historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the  ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is based on the results of this analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS&rsquo; history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS&rsquo; experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.&nbsp;NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known.&nbsp;&nbsp;While actuarial studies reflected a reduced level of favorable claims development between 2009 and 2010 (resulting in an increase of the annual cost related to personal injuries from $51 million to $75 million), a continued reduced level of favorable development in 2011 resulted in an increase in the annual cost related to personal injuries to $88 million in 2011 from $75 million in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower.</p>
<p align="left">NS is subject to various jurisdictions&rsquo; environmental laws and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is NS&rsquo; policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 16).&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.</p>
<p align="left">Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $32 million in 2011, $26 million in 2010, and<br>$20 million in 2009, and property additions for environmental matters totaled approximately $7 million in 2011,<br>
$8 million in 2010, and $11 million in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property additions for environmental matters in 2012 are expected to be about $9 million.</p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $35 million at December 31, 2011, and $33 million at December 31, 2010 (of which $12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period).&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2011, the liability represents NS&rsquo; estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 149 known locations and projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of that date, seven sites accounted for approximately $13 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.</p>
<p align="left">At 26 locations, one or more NS subsidiaries  in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS calculates its estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.</p>





<p align="left">With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS&rsquo; ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available clean-up technologies,  the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant&rsquo;s share of any estimated loss (and that participant&rsquo;s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.</p>

<p align="center">K32

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left">Based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is aware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>

<p align="left">Norfolk Southern and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in management&rsquo;s opinion, any such recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Income Taxes</strong></p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $7.5 billion at December 31, 2011 (see Note 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS had a $19 million valuation allowance on $957 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized. </p>
<p align="left">In addition, NS has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;For every one half percent change in the 2011 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $15 million.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>OTHER MATTERS</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Labor Agreements</strong></p>
<p align="left">More than 80% of NS&rsquo; railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).&nbsp;&nbsp;NS largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC). Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and  unions may propose changes.</p>






<p align="left">The NCCC&rsquo;s most recent round of bargaining began in November  2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current agreements with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA) extend through December 31, 2014, the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements will apply to the BLET and ATDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, NS bargains separately with longshoremen, who are represented by the International Longshoremen&rsquo;s Association (ILA), at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks and do not participate in national bargaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;A new national agreement was reached with the United Transportation Union (UTU) on September 16, 2011, setting forth terms and working conditions through December 31, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UTU represents conductors, trainmen, hostlers, and yardmasters.</p>

<p align="center">K33

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p>Generally, after a period of direct negotiations, either party may file for mediation if it believes insufficient progress is being made.&nbsp;&nbsp;The status quo is preserved during mediation while a federal mediator assists the parties in their efforts to reach an agreement and if unsuccessful, either party may seek self-help (strike or lockout) after a 30-day cooling off period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following failed mediation with two coalitions representing twelve unions, President Obama  created Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) No. 243 in October 2011, which delayed any strike for 60 days while the PEB investigated the facts of the dispute and made recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November 2011, the NCCC has reached tentative national mediated agreements with all twelve  unions, largely adopting the recommendations of the PEB.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreements with eleven of these unions have been ratified by their memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes  Division (BMWED) must still be ratified by its membership.</p>


<p align="left"><strong>Market Risks and Hedging Activities</strong></p>

<p align="left">NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2011, NS&rsquo; debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. A 1% point increase in interest rates would increase NS&rsquo; total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $2 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>New Accounting Pronouncements</strong></p>
<p align="left">In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)<br>
No. 2011-05, <em>&ldquo;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation of Comprehensive Income.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;This update, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;This update does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income or  the requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS will adopt this ASU retrospectively in the first quarter of 2012 however, effective December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, <em>&ldquo;Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to Presentation Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05,&rdquo;</em> which deferred the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income.&nbsp;&nbsp;This deferral is temporary until the FASB reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS expects adoption of the ASU will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, <em>&ldquo;Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820):&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;The update, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and expands certain other disclosures requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS will adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2012 and expects adoption of the ASU will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Inflation</strong></p>
<p align="left">In preparing financial statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS, a capital-intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.</p>



<p align="left"><strong>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</strong></p>
<p align="left">This Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;unlikely,&rdquo; and &ldquo;project.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward-looking statements reflect management&rsquo;s good-faith evaluation of information currently available.</p>
<p align="left">However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;transportation of hazardous materials as a common carrier by rail; acts of terrorism or war; general economic conditions; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges;  disruptions to NS&rsquo; technology infrastructure, including computer systems; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages;  commercial, operating, environmental, and climate change legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and floods;  unavailability of qualified personnel due to unpredictability of demand for rail services; fluctuation in supplies and prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; and  changes in securities and capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part II, Item 1A &ldquo;Risk Factors.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward-looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</strong>
<br><br><br>
<p align="left">The Board of Directors and Stockholders<br>
  Norfolk Southern Corporation:
<p align="left">We have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).&nbsp;&nbsp;Norfolk Southern
Corporation&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
<p align="left">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&nbsp;&nbsp;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<p align="left">A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
<p align="left">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
<p align="left">In our opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework,</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
<p align="left">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 15, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.<br><br><br><br />

These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
<p align="left">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&nbsp;&nbsp;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp;&nbsp;An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<p align="left">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

<p align="center"><strong>Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries<br>
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</strong></p>
<p><br>
<p align="left">The following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
<p align="left"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</strong>
<p align="left"><strong>Description of Business</strong>
<p align="left">Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business, operating approximately 20,000 route miles primarily in the East and Midwest.&nbsp;&nbsp;These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).&nbsp;&nbsp;All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
<p align="left">NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following market groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2011):&nbsp; coal (31%); intermodal (19%); agriculture/consumer products/government (13%); chemicals (12%); metals/construction (11%);  automotive (7%); and, paper/clay/forest products (7%).&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of NS&rsquo; customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 80% of NS&rsquo; railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
<p align="left"><strong>Use of Estimates</strong>
<p align="left">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management periodically reviews its estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.
<p align="left"><strong>Revenue Recognition</strong>
<p align="left">Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination and related expenses are recognized as incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of management&rsquo;s best estimate of projected liability, which is based on historical activity, current traffic counts and the expectation of future activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS regularly monitors its contract refund liability and, historically, the estimates have not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switching, demurrage and other incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

<p align="left"><strong>Cash Equivalents</strong>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Cash equivalents&rdquo; are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</strong> </p>
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; allowance for doubtful accounts was $4 million at  December 31, 2011 and $5 million at December 31, 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine its allowance for doubtful accounts, NS evaluates historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Materials and Supplies</strong> </p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Materials and supplies,&rdquo; consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in &ldquo;Properties.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">K44

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">



<p align="left"><strong>Investments</strong>
<p align="left">Debt securities classified as &ldquo;held-to-maturity&rdquo; are reported at amortized cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketable equity and debt securities classified as &ldquo;trading&rdquo; or &ldquo;available-for-sale&rdquo; are recorded at fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrealized after-tax gains and losses for investments designated as
&ldquo;available-for-sale&rdquo; are recognized in &ldquo;Accumulated other comprehensive loss.&rdquo;
<p align="left">Investments where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus NS&rsquo; equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.
<p align="left"><strong>Properties</strong>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Properties&rdquo; are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method of depreciation whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS uses more than 60 depreciable asset classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary depreciation method for NS&rsquo; asset base is group life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources (see Note 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes both depreciation and depletion.
<p align="left">NS&rsquo; depreciation expense is based on management&rsquo;s assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing these assumptions, NS&rsquo; management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB.&nbsp; Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:
<ul>
  <li>statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;</li>
  <li>review of historical salvage received and current market rates;</li>
  <li>review of NS&rsquo; operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;</li>
  <li>review of accounting policies and assumptions; and</li>
  <li>industry review and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.</p>

<p>NS&rsquo; recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2011, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 33.3% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.32% to 37.84%.</p>



<p align="center">K45

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p>NS capitalizes interest on major capital projects during the period of their construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an assets&rsquo; useful life or increase its utility, are capitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and equipment, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that clearly relate to a particular project. Due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry, a significant portion of annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets. Because removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement, removal costs are estimated based on an average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset&rsquo;s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.</p>

<p>When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;When retiring rail, ties and ballast, NS uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in &ldquo;Other income &#8211; net&rdquo;<br>(see Note 2) since such income is not a product of NS&rsquo; railroad operations.</p>

<p align="left">A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings.</p>

<p align="left">NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Required Accounting Changes</strong>
<p align="left">In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-09, <em>&ldquo;Disclosures about an Employer&rsquo;s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;This update, effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011, requires additional disclosures about employers&rsquo; participation in multiemployer pension plans, including information about the plan&rsquo;s funded status if readily available.&nbsp;&nbsp;This update also requires additional limited disclosures for multiemployer plans that provide postretirement benefits other than pension.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS adopted this ASU in our December 31, 2011 annual financial statements, the adoption of which did not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p align="left">In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, <em>&ldquo;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):&nbsp;Presentation of Comprehensive Income.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;This update, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;This update does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income or  the requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS will adopt this ASU retrospectively in the first quarter of 2012 however, effective December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, <em>&ldquo;Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to Presentation Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05,&rdquo;</em> which deferred the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income.&nbsp;&nbsp;This deferral is temporary until the FASB reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS expects adoption of the ASU will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>During 2010, NS performed a review and re-evaluation of its estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a reduction of income tax expense of $34 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, provisions of the health care legislation enacted during 2010 eliminate, after 2012, the tax deduction available for reimbursed prescription drug expenses under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.&nbsp;&nbsp;As required by ASC 740, <em>&ldquo;Income Taxes,&rdquo;</em> NS recorded a $27 million charge to deferred tax expense in 2010.</p>

<p align="left">Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, are potential benefits of $42 million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.</p>
<p align="left">NS expects that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, will decrease by approximately<br>$10 million in 2012 due to tax positions for which there was an uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier years but deductibility may become certain by the the close of 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; consolidated federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).&nbsp;&nbsp;NS anticipates that the IRS will complete its examination of the 2009 and 2010 tax years within the next twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the return.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, NS is generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has  various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeals, or litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in 2012 as a result of the lapse of state statutes of limitations, but the amount is not expected to be significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS does not expect that any of the aforementioned potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits will have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>
<p align="left">Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in &ldquo;Other income &#8211; net,&rdquo; amounted to $10 million of income in 2011, $1 million of expense in 2010, and $6 million of income in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no penalties related to tax matters in 2011,  2010, and 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has recorded a liability of $4 million at December 31, 2011, and $14 million at December 31, 2010, for the payment of interest on unrecognized tax benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has no liability recorded at<br>December 31, 2011 and 2010, for the payment of penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Investment in Conrail</strong></p>
<p align="left">Through a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).&nbsp;&nbsp;NS has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail&rsquo;s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail&rsquo;s depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail&rsquo;s tangible assets and liabilities.</p>

<p align="left">At December 31, 2011, based on the funded status of Conrail&rsquo;s pension plans, NS decreased its proportional investment in Conrail by $21 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;This resulted in a loss of $19 million recorded to &ldquo;Other comprehensive loss&rdquo; and a combined federal and state deferred tax asset of $2 million.</p>

<p align="left">At December 31, 2010, based on the funded status of Conrail&rsquo;s pension plans, NS increased its proportional investment in Conrail by $9 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;This resulted in income of $8 million recorded to &ldquo;Other comprehensive loss&rdquo; and a combined federal and state deferred tax liability of $1 million.</p>
<p align="left">At December 31, 2011, the difference between NS&rsquo; investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail&rsquo;s underlying net equity was $542 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, included in &ldquo;Other income &#8211; net&rdquo; was<br>$31 million, $26 million, and $32 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.</p>

<p align="left">CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Purchased services and rents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fuel&rdquo; include expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling<br>$131 million in 2011, $118 million in 2010, and $123 million in 2009. Future minimum lease payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;$33 million in each of 2012 through 2016 and $243 million thereafter. NS provides certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate $7 million annually.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Accounts payable&rdquo; includes $160 million at December 31, 2011, and $128 million at December 31, 2010, due to Conrail for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, &ldquo;Other liabilities&rdquo; includes $133 million at<br>December 31, 2011 and  2010, for long-term advances from Conrail, maturing 2035, that bear interest at an average rate of 4.4%.</p>

<p>During the fourth quarter of 2011, NS issued $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due 2021 and an additional<br>$100 million of 6% senior notes due 2111.</p>

<p align="left">During the third quarter of 2011, NS issued $600 million of unsecured notes ($596 million at 4.837% due 2041 and<br>
  $4 million at 6% due 2111) and paid $146 million of premium in exchange for $526 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($422 million at 7.05% due 2037, $77 million at 7.90% due 2097, and $27 million at 7.25% due 2031). The premium is reflected as a reduction of debt in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the debt exchange.</p>

<p>During the second quarter of 2011, NS issued an additional $400 million of 6% senior notes due 2111.</p>

<p>During the third quarter of 2010, NS issued an additional $250 million of 6% senior notes due 2105.</p>

<p align="left"> NS has in place  a $350 million receivables securitization facility under which NSR sells substantially all of its eligible third-party receivables to a subsidiary, which in turn may transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amounts received under the facility are accounted for as borrowings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this facility, NS received  and repaid $100 million in 2011.</p>

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left">At December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, the amounts outstanding under the receivables securitization facility were $200 million at an average variable interest rate of 1.35% and $200 million at an average variable interest rate of 1.54%.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; intent is to refinance $100 million of these borrowings on a long-term basis, which is supported by its<br>$750 million credit agreement (see below).&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, these amounts outstanding are included in the line item &ldquo;Long-term debt&rdquo; and the remaining $100 million outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is included in the line item &ldquo;Short-term debt&rdquo; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility has a 364-day term which was renewed and amended in October 2011 to run until October 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amounts of receivables included in &ldquo;Accounts receivable &#8211; net&rdquo; serving as collateral for these borrowings were $745 million and $647 million, respectively.</p>

<p align="left">The equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens on the underlying equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to satisfy yen-denominated lease payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;These deposits are included in &ldquo;Other assets&rdquo; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $14 million at December 31, 2011, and $35 million at December 31, 2010.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Issuance of Debt or Equity Securities</strong></p>
<p align="left">NS has authority from its Board of Directors to issue an additional $1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Credit Agreement, Debt Covenants, and Commercial Paper</strong></p>
<p align="left">In December 2011, NS renewed and amended its five-year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The renewed and amended, five-year agreement, which expires in 2016, reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from $1 billion to $750 million to more closely match NS&rsquo; liquidity requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS had no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and NS is in compliance with all of its covenants.</p>
<p align="left">NS has the ability to issue commercial paper supported by its $750 million credit agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2011 and 2010, NS had no outstanding commercial paper.</p>

<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lease Commitments</strong></p>
<p>NS is committed under long-term lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2067, for equipment, lines of road and other property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amounts do not include payments to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements (see Note 5).&nbsp;&nbsp;Future minimum lease payments and operating lease expense are as follows:</p>

<p>To determine the discount rates, NS utilized analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS uses the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Health Care Cost Trend Assumptions</strong></p>
<p align="left">For measurement purposes at December 31, 2011, increases in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 7.7% for 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2019 and remain at that level thereafter.</p>
<p align="left">Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:</p>

<p>The other postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31, 2011, of 56% in equity securities and 44% in debt securities compared with 58% in equity securities and 42% in debt securities at December 31, 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;The target asset allocation for equity is between 50% and 75% of the plan&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<p align="left">The plans&rsquo; assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and  historic returns for the plans&rsquo; asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market returns for those asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three-year period. NS assumed a rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.75% for 2011, 2010, and 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;A one percentage point change to the rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million change to the net pension  cost and, as a result, an equal change in &ldquo;Compensation and benefits&rdquo; expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2012, NS assumes an 8.25% return on pension plan assets.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Fair Value of Plan Assets</strong></p>
<p align="left">Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value.</p>
<blockquote>

  <p align="left">Common stock:&nbsp;&nbsp;Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market.</p>

  <p align="left">Common collective trusts:&nbsp;&nbsp;Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents.</p>

  <p align="left">Corporate bonds and other fixed income instruments:&nbsp;&nbsp;When available, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using observable market inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using unobservable market inputs.</p>

  <p align="left">Municipal bonds:&nbsp;&nbsp;Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable market based inputs.</p>

  <p align="left">Commingled funds:&nbsp;&nbsp;Valued at the NAV of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;The commingled funds hold equity securities.</p>

  <p align="left">Interest bearing cash:&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are traded.</p>

  <p align="left">United States Government and agencies securities:&nbsp;&nbsp;Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable as well as unobservable market based inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation adjusted instruments utilize the appropriate index factor.</p>


  <p align="left">Preferred stock:&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using observable as well as unobservable market-based inputs.</p>

<p align="left">Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Trust-owned life insurance:&nbsp;&nbsp;valued at NS&rsquo; share of the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company.&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying investments of that trust consist of a U.S. stock account, and a U.S. bond account, valued based upon the aggregate market values of the underlying investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan asset account is valued at cash surrender value at the time of the loan, plus accrued interest.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The other postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of $186 million and $178 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are valued under level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 1 or level 3 related assets.</p>

<p align="left">The methods used to value pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, while NS believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments</strong></p>
    <p align="left">In 2012, NS expects to contribute approximately $12 million to its unfunded pension plans for payments to pensioners and approximately $56 million to its other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS does not expect to contribute to its funded pension plan in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, NS made a voluntary contribution to its funded pension plan of $100 million.</p>

<p>The other postretirement benefits payments include an estimated average annual reduction due to the Medicare Part D subsidy of approximately $7 million.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Other Postretirement Coverage</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Under collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $48 million in 2011, $43 million in 2010, and $33 million in  2009.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Section 401(k) Plans</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the plans, NS matches a portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS&rsquo; matching contributions, recorded as an expense, under these plans were $17 million in 2011, $15 million in 2010, and $16 million in 2009.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock-Based Compensation</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of nonemployee directors of the Board or the chief executive officer (if delegated such authority by the committee) may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of 96,125,000 shares of Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants; as a broad-based issuance, stockholder approval was not required.</p>

<p align="left">In May 2010, the stockholders approved an amended LTIP that eliminated the previous limit on the number of shares of stock that could be granted as RSUs, restricted shares, or performance shares and instead adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than a stock option or stock-settled SAR.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan, stockholder approval of TSOP was not required.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS uses newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.</p>

<p align="center">K65

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">



<p>The LTIP also permits the payment &#8211; on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock &#8211; of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock options, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death, the Corporation shall have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding RSUs, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason other than retirement, disability, or death, the Corporation shall have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstanding PSUs do not currently receive dividend equivalent payments.</p>

<p align="left">During the first quarter of 2011, a committee of nonemployee directors of NS&rsquo; Board granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to TSOP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt of an award under LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee&rsquo;s execution of a non-compete agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject to forfeiture in the event the awardee &ldquo;engages in competing employment&rdquo; for a period of time following retirement.</p>
    <p><strong>Accounting Method</strong></p>
    <p>NS accounts for its grants of stock options RSUs, PSUs, dividend equivalents, and tax absorption payments in accordance with ASC 718 <em>&ldquo;Compensation-Stock Compensation.&rdquo;</em> Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalents, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income. Related compensation costs were $61 million in 2011, $67 million in 2010, and $60 million in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total tax effects recognized in income in relation to stock-based compensation were benefits of $20 million in 2011, $21 million in 2010, and $18 million in 2009.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Common stock issued &#8211; net&rdquo; in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 includes tax benefits generated from tax deductions in excess of compensation costs recognized (excess tax benefits) for share-based awards of $45 million, $33 million, and $15 million, respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Stock Options</strong></p>
<p>Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years and are subject to a vesting period of at least one year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Option exercise prices are at not less than the fair market value of Common Stock on the effective date of the grant and, effective for awards granted after May 13, 2010, may not be less than the higher of (i) the average fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2011, 627,700 options were granted under the LTIP and 257,000 options were granted under the TSOP.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each case, the grant price was $62.75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The options granted under the LTIP and TSOP in 2011 may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of the options granted under the LTIP in 2011 who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for four years in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividend equivalent payments are not made on TSOP options.</p>
    <p>In the first quarter of 2010, 824,900 options were granted under the LTIP and 259,800 options were granted under the TSOP, each with a grant price of $47.76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The options granted under the LTIP and TSOP in 2010 may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively. In the first quarter of 2009, 1,209,700 options were granted under the LTIP and 251,200 options were granted under the TSOP, each with a grant price of $38.71.&nbsp; The options granted under the LTIP and TSOP in 2009 may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both 2010 and 2009, the grant price was the higher of (i) the average fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant, and the options have a term of ten years.</p>

<p align="left">The fair value of each option awarded in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was measured on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on Common Stock and historical volatility of Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average expected option life is derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;For options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of zero was used.&nbsp;&nbsp;For  2011, 2010, and 2009, a dividend yield of 2.55%, 2.89%, and 2.4%, respectively, was used for LTIP options for periods where no dividend equivalent payments are made, as well as for TSOP options, which do not receive dividend equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions for the 2011, 2010, and 2009 LTIP and TSOP grants are shown in the following table:</p>

<p align="left">During  2011, 2010, and 2009, dividend equivalent payments were made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, the total amount of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units were deducted from net income to determine income available to common stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, NS  evaluates on a grant-by-grant basis those stock options and restricted stock units receiving dividend equivalent payments under the two-class and treasury stock methods to determine which method is the more dilutive for each grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those grants for which the two-class method was more dilutive, net income was reduced by the amount of dividend equivalent payments on these grants to determine income available to common stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The diluted calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average market price of Common Stock as follows:&nbsp;none in 2011, none in 2010 and  1.4 million in 2009.</p>







<p align="left"><strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments and Contingencies</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Lawsuits</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Norfolk Southern and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in management&rsquo;s opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known.</p>

<p align="left">Two of NS&rsquo; customers, DuPont and South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA), filed  rate reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS  disputes these allegations, however, in August 2011, NS agreed to settle the rate reasonableness complaint with SMEPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement of this claim did not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since  June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, NS has been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management presently expects resolution of the DuPont case  to occur in  2013 and believes the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to rate cases, management records adjustments to revenues in the periods, if and when, such adjustments are probable and estimable.</p>

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

    <p align="left">On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against NS and other Class 1 railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS believes the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawsuit containing similar allegations against NS and four other major railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.</p>



<p align="left"><strong>Casualty Claims</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Casualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;To aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, NS&rsquo; management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-related accidental injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers&rsquo; Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.&nbsp;&nbsp;FELA&rsquo;s fault-based system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers&rsquo; compensation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in management&rsquo;s opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.</p>
    <p align="left">The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS&rsquo; insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million)  of the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge during the first quarter of 2011 for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 2010, NS settled an arbitration claim ($100 million) with another insurance carrier with no adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>




<p align="left"><strong>Employee personal injury claims</strong> &#8211; The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is employee personal injury costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent actuarial firm engaged by NS provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing its employee personal injury liability and estimating its employee personal injury expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actuarial firm studies NS&rsquo; historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actuary uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims. NS adjusts its liability quarterly based upon management&rsquo;s assessment and the results of the study. Actuarial studies since 2009 have reflected a reduced level of favorable claims development resulting in an increase of the annual cost related to personal injuries from $51 million in 2009, to $75 million in 2010, and $88 million in 2011. The estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Occupational claims</strong> &#8211; Occupational claims (including asbestosis and other respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to repetitive motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon NS&rsquo; history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The liability is dependent upon management&rsquo;s judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the consulting independent actuarial firm in the periodic studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actuarial firm&rsquo;s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting NS&rsquo; experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS adjusts its liability quarterly based upon management&rsquo;s assessment and the results of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.</p>

<p align="center">K72

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

<p align="left"><strong>Third-party claims</strong> &#8211; NS records a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries, automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent actuarial firm assists with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading damage, based upon NS&rsquo; experience including number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses. The actuarial estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported. Each quarter NS adjusts its liability based upon management&rsquo;s assessment and the results of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded.</p>



<p align="left"><strong>Environmental Matters</strong></p>
<p align="left">NS is subject to various jurisdictions&rsquo; environmental laws and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is NS&rsquo; policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims, if any, against third parties, for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS also has an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.</p>

<p align="left">NS&rsquo; Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $35 million at December 31, 2011, and $33 million at December 31, 2010 (of which $12 million is classified as a current liability at December 31, 2011 and 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2011, the liability represents NS&rsquo; estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 149 known locations and projects compared with 143 locations and projects at December 31, 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2011, seven sites accounted for approximately $13 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.</p>
<p align="left">At 26 locations, one or more Norfolk Southern subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS calculates its estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.</p>




<p align="left">With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS&rsquo; ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available clean-up technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant&rsquo;s share of any estimated loss (and that participant&rsquo;s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.</p>

<p align="left">The risk of incurring environmental liability &#8211; for acts and omissions, past, present, and future &#8211; is inherent in the railroad business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the commodities in NS&rsquo; traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.</p>
    <p align="left">Based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is aware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>

<p align="center">K73

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

    <p align="left"><strong>Insurance</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Norfolk Southern obtains on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;NS is currently self-insured up to $50 million and above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS&rsquo; care, custody, or control.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Purchase Commitments</strong></p>
<p align="left">At December 31, 2011, NS had outstanding purchase commitments totaling approximately $603 million for long-term service contracts through 2019 as well as track material, RoadRailer&reg; trailers, and freight cars, in connection with its capital programs through 2016.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Change-In-Control Arrangements</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Norfolk Southern has compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as defined in those agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual&rsquo;s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Guarantees</strong></p>
    <p align="left">In a number of instances, Norfolk Southern and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to NS&rsquo; financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore NS&rsquo; exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.&nbsp;&nbsp;No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of one type of equipment financing, NSR&rsquo;s Japanese leverage leases, NSR may terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law indemnity is triggered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a termination would require NSR to make early termination payments that would not be expected to have a material effect on NS&rsquo; financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.</p>

<p align="left">NS has agreed to indemnify parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, NS has the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required to make any payments under these indemnities.</p>

<p align="left">As of December 31, 2011, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to<br>$7 million of indebtedness, due in 2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.&nbsp;&nbsp;No liability has been recorded related to this guaranty.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</strong></p>
<p align="left">Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of NS&rsquo; disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of December 31, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, NS&rsquo; disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in NS&rsquo; reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</strong></p>
    <p align="left">The management of Norfolk Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to its ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.</p>
<p align="left">In order to ensure that Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in <em>Internal Control-Integrated Framework</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our assessment, management has concluded that Norfolk Southern maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.</p>
    <p align="left">The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management.&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.</p>
    <p align="left">Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;These reports appear in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.</p>
    <p align="left">During the fourth quarter of 2011, management has not identified any changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, NS&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Norfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)</u></strong></p>
<p>Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity for non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 23, 2001, the Board of Directors further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to participants who are not officers of Norfolk Southern.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuance of these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was not required.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on<br>January 23, 2001, the Board amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2001, that included the reservation for issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock.</p>
    <p>In May 2010, shareholders approved an amended LTIP that adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash payments of restricted units, stock appreciation rights, and performance share units will not be applied against the maximum number of shares issuable under LTIP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any shares of Common Stock subject to options, performance share units, restricted shares, or restricted stock units which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.</p>


<p align="center">K78

<hr /><br style="page-break-before:always">

    <p>Non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under LTIP, the Compensation Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted shares, performance share units, and performance shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, dividend equivalents may be awarded for options, restricted stock units, and performance share units.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may make awards under LTIP subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.</p>

  <p>For options granted after May 13, 2010, the option price will  be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which  Common Stock is traded on the date of  grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.&nbsp;&nbsp;LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.</p>

<p>Performance share units entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year performance cycle based on Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s performance during that three-year period.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2012 performance share unit awards,  corporate performance will be measured using three equally weighted standards established by the Committee:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) three-year average return on average capital invested, (2) three-year average operating ratio, and (3) three-year total return to stockholders as compared with the average total return on the publicly traded stocks of North American Class I railroads, using a 20-day average total shareholder return to measure performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance share units may be payable in either shares of Common Stock or cash.
</p>
    <p>Restricted stock units are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than 60 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the restriction period, the holder of the restricted stock units has no beneficial ownership interest in the Common Stock represented by the restricted stock units and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent rights that may be awarded with respect to the restricted stock units).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period, but settlement of any restricted stock units will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed.
</p>
    <p><u><strong>Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP)</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>The Board adopted the TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.&nbsp;&nbsp;TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by stockholders.
</p>
    <p>Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under TSOP, the Committee may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP.
    </p>
    <p>The option price will  be at least    the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Options awarded in 2011 are subject to a three-year vesting period.&nbsp;&nbsp;TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><u>Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors&rsquo; Restricted Stock Plan (Plan)</u></strong></p>
    <p align="left">The Plan was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of Norfolk Southern Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further align their ownership interest in Norfolk Southern with that of stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make grants eligible to directors, Norfolk Southern purchases, through one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Common Stock already owned by one or more of Norfolk Southern&rsquo;s subsidiary companies.</p>



<p align="left">Only non-employee directors who are not and never have been employees of Norfolk Southern are eligible to participate in the Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon becoming a director, each eligible director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;No individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any director or the number of shares granted.</p>

<p align="left">The restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient&rsquo;s death or six months after the recipient ceases to be a director by reason of disability or retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors will forfeit the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of Norfolk Southern for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.</p>
