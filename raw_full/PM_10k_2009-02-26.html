STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Philip Morris International Benefit Equalization Plan governs the rights of an Employee whose benefit under the Retirement Plan or the Profit-Sharing
Plan, or both Qualified Plans, is subject to one or more of the Statutory Limitations, or to the nondiscrimination requirements of Section&nbsp;401(a)(4) of the Code and the coverage requirements of Section&nbsp;410(b) of the Code. The liabilities
allocable to Employees, former employees and retired employees of the international tobacco operations conducted by the Company and the other Participating Companies have been transferred from the Benefit Equalization Plan maintained by Altria
Corporate Services, Inc. to the Plan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Employees who received target payments pursuant to a Supplemental Enrollment Agreement generally are
not eligible to participate in the Plan with respect to services provided after December&nbsp;31, 2004, but, instead, are eligible to accrue future benefits under a separate plan. It is intended that Grandfathered Benefit Equalization Retirement
Allowances and Grandfathered Benefit Equalization Profit-Sharing Allowances with respect to Grandfathered Employees and Grandfathered Retired Employees (as well as their spouses and beneficiaries) not be subject to the requirements of
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and that the Plan be interpreted and administered in accordance with this intention. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Plan as hereinafter
set forth shall be effective with respect to Employees who incur a Separation from Service on or after January&nbsp;1, 2008, except as otherwise provided herein. The Plan will also be the source of benefits to former employees of Philip Morris
International Inc. and its subsidiaries who terminated employment prior to January&nbsp;1, 2008. The provisions of the Plan shall not be construed to change the time and form of payment of that portion of the Benefit Equalization Retirement
Allowance (referred to as a Grandfathered Benefit Equalization Retirement Allowance) and that portion of the Benefit Equalization Profit-Sharing Allowance (referred to as a Grandfathered Benefit Equalization Profit-Sharing Allowance) considered
deferred before January&nbsp;1, 2005 (within the meaning of Final Regulation &#167;1.409A-6(a)(2) and other provisions of the Final Regulations) of a Grandfathered Retired Employee. </FONT></P> <P

provisions of the plan in which he was a participant as in effect on his Separation from Service or date of becoming an Inactive Participant, as the case may be, except to the extent that the administrator of the plan has determined in his sole
discretion to administer the plan in good faith compliance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and any then published guidance and to not subject any Grandfathered Benefit Equalization Retirement Allowance and Grandfathered Benefit Equalization
Profit-Sharing Allowance to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Plan is comprised of three separate plans, programs or arrangements. Each
plan shall be treated as a separate plan, program or arrangement from the other plans. One of the plans provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) solely in excess of the Section&nbsp;415 Limitations; the second
plan provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) attributable solely to the Compensation Limitation; and the third plan provides benefits to a Retired Employee (or his Spouse or other Beneficiary) because payment of
the benefit from one or both of the Qualified Plans could result in a failure to meet </FONT>
