<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA
could be commercially successful in cellular wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for
Code Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital
wireless communications networks (also known as wireless networks). CDMA and TDMA (Time Division
Multiple Access), of which Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)&nbsp;is the primary commercial
form, are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit a wireless device user&#146;s
voice or data over radio waves using a public cellular wireless network. Because we led, and
continue to lead, the development and commercialization of CDMA technology, we own significant
intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, which applies to
all versions of CDMA, portions of which we license to other companies and implement in our own
products. The wireless communications industry generally recognizes that a company seeking to
develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technology will require a patent license
from us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also continue our leading role in the development of Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)-based technologies, for which we have substantial intellectual
property. Our CDMA licensees&#146; sales of multimode third generation (3G) CDMA and OFDMA devices are
covered by their existing CDMA license agreements with us. We have begun to license companies to
make and sell single-mode OFDMA devices. In addition, nine companies have royalty-bearing licenses
under our patent portfolio for use in single-mode OFDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Our Revenues</I></B><I>. </I>We generate revenues by licensing portions of our intellectual property to
manufacturers of wireless products (such as wireless phones and other devices and the
infrastructure required to establish and operate a wireless network). We receive licensing fees and
royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our patented technologies. We also
sell products and services, which include:

are increasingly focused on providing broadband wireless access to the Internet, as well as e-mail,
multimedia, entertainment, messaging, social networking, mobile commerce and position location

third-generation (3G) wireless networks and 3G devices which are capable of supporting higher data

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth in the use of wireless devices worldwide and demand for enhanced
network functionality requires constant innovation to further improve network reliability, expand
capacity and introduce new types of services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations
of wireless telecommunications technology standards have evolved. The adoption of wireless
standards for mobile communications within individual countries is generally determined by the
telecommunication service providers operating in those countries and, in some instances, local
government regulations. Such determinations are typically based on economic criteria and the
service provider&#146;s evaluation of each technology&#146;s ability to provide the features and
functionality required for its business plan. More than two decades ago, the European Community
developed regulations requiring the use of the GSM standard, a TDMA-based, 2G technology. In
addition, there are several versions of CDMA technology that have been adopted worldwide as public
cellular standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a 2G cellular technology that was first
commercially deployed in the mid-1990s. The other subsequent versions of CDMA are popularly
referred to as 3G technologies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Second Generation. </I></B>Compared to first generation analog systems, 2G digital technology provided
for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed spectrum resulting in greatly increased voice
capacity. 2G technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail,
facsimile, connections to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of
service options and greater fraud protection. However, data services (e-mail, fax, computer
connections) were generally limited to low speed transmission rates. The main 2G digital cellular
technologies are called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, North American
TDMA, PDC (Personal Digital Cellular, a variant of North American TDMA), and GSM, also a form of
TDMA. Sales of North American TDMA and PDC phones have been discontinued with subscribers being
moved to GSM or 3G technologies. Wireless operators have shut down, or are planning to shut down,
usage of these 2G systems. Similarly, analog systems have been shut down in most places.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of 3G CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA- and GSM-based
technologies include increased network capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with internet
protocols, higher capacity for data and faster access to data (Internet) and higher data throughput
rates. GSM has the benefit of more widespread roaming availability due to its wider worldwide
deployment. Handset selling price was once considered an advantage of GSM, however, low-priced
CDMA2000 handsets of $30 or less (wholesale sales price) are available today, further enabling
wireless CDMA growth in developing regions. The price differential between low-end 3G CDMA2000
devices and GSM devices is diminishing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDMA2000 (1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A) networks are deployed by operators in several markets
that support both voice and a wide range of high-speed wireless data services. Enhancements based
upon the CDAM2000 Revision E Standard, sometimes called 1x-Advanced, are being planned for CDMA2000
1X that will further increase voice capacity and data performance. Developments of 1xEV-DO Revision
B are expected to increase data rates and capacities. Standardization work is proceeding on what is
expected to be 1xEV-DO Revision C, sometimes called DO-Advanced. Enhancements based upon improved
implementations have and will continue to be deployed in our products to increase capacity and data
rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GSM operators around the world, including those in the European Community and AT&#038;T in the
United States, have focused primarily on the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access-Frequency Division
Duplexing (UTRA-FDD) radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA (standardized as
UMTS), which is based on our underlying CDMA technology and incorporates many of our patented
inventions (as are all of the CDMA radio interfaces of the IMT-2000 standard). The majority of the
world&#146;s leading wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 105) have licensed our
technology for use in WCDMA products, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of the 3G
technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of GSM operators deployed second and a half generation (2.5G) mobile packet data
technologies, such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and
Enhanced Data
Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), in areas serviced by GSM as a bridging technology while they
waited for 3G WCDMA devices to become more readily available and affordable so they can justify the
expense of upgrading their GSM system to provide WCDMA service. In some regions of the world,
regulatory restrictions have prevented deploying WCDMA in the lower frequency bands used by GSM,
thus requiring more cell sites for WCDMA to provide coverage. As a result, in less dense areas,
some wireless operators have not deployed WCDMA. From a technological perspective, we do not
believe that GPRS and EDGE effectively compete with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a
cost per bit transmitted or performance basis. The European Union permitted IMT-2000 technologies,
which include WCDMA, to be deployed in the lower frequency 900 MHz band. This is called UMTS900.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the underlying core principles of CDMA
technology; however, the CDMA2000 mode enables a direct and more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. Most cdmaOne operators have deployed CDMA2000 1X and have augmented their
networks with 1xEV-DO. While the WCDMA wireless air interface does use CDMA technology for
communications between the wireless device and the network, the core network is an upgraded GSM
core network, which is why GSM operators will deploy WCDMA rather than  CDMA2000. Our
intellectual property rights include a valuable patent portfolio essential to implementation of
each of the 3G CDMA alternative standards and patents that are useful for commercially successful
product implementations. Generally, we have licensed substantially all of our patents to our CDMA
subscriber and infrastructure equipment licensees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3G CDMA versions (CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) from a technological
perspective require separate implementations and are not interchangeable. While the fundamental
core technologies are derived from CDMA and, in addition to other features and functionality, are
covered by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network design and
management. However, subscriber roaming amongst systems using different air interfaces is made
possible through multimode wireless devices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various revisions of the 3G CDMA specifications have significantly increased performance
capacity and data speeds. It is expected that future revisions of the 3G CDMA specifications will
provide further enhancements. Many wireless operators are planning to deploy technology based on
OFDMA to complement their existing 3G networks to provide additional bandwidth for data
communications when they have access to new and wider spectrum resources. 3GPP has specified an
OFDMA system called Long Term Evolution (LTE), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE)&nbsp;has specified 802.16 (WiMax). The OFDMA technologies that have been standardized

level of mobile broadband data services based on OFDMA technologies. 3GPP has specified, as part
of Release 8, an OFDMA-based air interface called LTE to deliver higher mobile broadband data rates
using channel bandwidths up to 20 MHz. LTE has an FDD version and a TDD version, called TD-LTE. LTE
has been accepted to be part of the IMT-2000
specification as part of the normal update process. 3GPP is currently developing Release 9 of LTE
and has started working on Release 10. The LTE portion of Release 10, called LTE-Advanced, has been
proposed to be part of the IMT-Advanced specifications. Several years ago, the ITU created
IMT-Advanced as a follow-on process to IMT-2000 to encourage development of next generation air
interfaces. Both IMT-2000 and IMT-Advanced are under the umbrella of IMT. The ITU recognizes any of
the IMT technologies as being deployable in any spectrum identified by the ITU in the World Radio
Conferences (WRC)&nbsp;for mobile communications. Multiple wireless operators, including AT&#038;T and
Verizon Wireless, have communicated their commitment to LTE as their next generation technology
path.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the 3G economies of scale greatly improve the availability and cost structure of
3GPP and 3GPP2 evolved technologies. The OFDMA family of standards is expected to be complementary
with 3G services, and we expect to provide multimode chipsets capable of operating across multiple
CDMA- and OFDMA-based technology deployment scenarios.</DIV>

foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test
manufacturing processes. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our
integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We rely on
independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the
testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most
of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The majority of our
integrated circuits are purchased using a two-stage manufacturing business model, in which we
purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party
manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing
business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). We also employ a turnkey model in which
our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated
circuits. Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer advanced

equipment, we have made our essential CDMA patents available to competitors of our QCT segment. We
have entered into agreements with certain companies, including but not limited to Broadcom,
Fujitsu, Infineon, NEC, Philips, Renesas and Texas Instruments. These agreements permit the
manufacture of CDMA-based integrated circuits. In exchange for these rights, we are, in various
cases, entitled to receive fees, royalties and/or rights that allow us to use these companies&#146; CDMA
and, in some cases, certain non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In every case,
these agreements do not allow such integrated circuit suppliers to pass through rights under
Qualcomm&#146;s patents to such suppliers&#146; customers, and such customers&#146; sales of CDMA-, WCDMA- and
OFDMA-based cellular devices into which such suppliers&#146; integrated circuits are incorporated

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of
digital wireless communications technology and services. On a worldwide basis, we currently compete
primarily with the GSM/GPRS/EDGE digital wireless telecommunications technologies. GSM has been
utilized extensively in Europe, much of Asia other than Japan and South Korea, and certain other
countries. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA, however, CDMA technologies have
been adopted for all 3G wireless systems. In addition, most GSM operators have deployed GPRS, a
packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge technology, and a number of GSM operators have deployed or
are expected to deploy EDGE, while considering the use of 3G WCDMA for their system. A limited
number of wireless operators have commercially deployed and other wireless operators have started
testing OFDMA technology, a multi-carrier transmission technique not based on CDMA technology,
which divides the available spectrum into many carriers, with each carrier being modulated at a low
data rate relative to the combined rate for all carriers. According to Global mobile Suppliers
Association, in its October&nbsp;2009 reports, 42 operators have committed to deploy LTE networks, an
OFDMA-based technology. We have invested in both the acquisition and the development of OFDMA
technology and intellectual property. We expect that upon the deployment of OFDMA-based networks,
the products implementing such technologies will be multimode and will also implement CDMA-based
technologies. The licenses granted under our existing CDMA license agreements generally cover
multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their
agreements for such devices. Further, nine companies have royalty-bearing
licenses under our patent portfolio for use in single-mode OFDMA products (i.e., products that
implement OFDMA-based standards but do not implement any CDMA-based standards).

cost of the device. An IMOD display should cost less to manufacture than a comparable liquid
crystal display because it requires fewer components and processing steps, thus supporting advanced
multimedia capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices.

greater technical, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities and greater access to channels,
including in regions primarily deploying 2G wireless communications technology. These competitors
also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or
with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may
affect customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share to our detriment. In addition, many of these companies are licensees of our technologies and
have established market positions, trade names, trademarks, patents, copyrights, intellectual
property rights and substantial technological capabilities. We may face competition throughout the
world with new technologies and services introduced in the future as additional competitors enter
the marketplace for products based on 3G standards, OFDMA-based technologies or other wireless
technologies. Although we intend to continue to develop improvements to existing technologies, as
well as potential new technologies, there may be a continuing competitive threat from companies
introducing alternative versions of wireless technologies. We also expect that the price we charge
for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary
information to maintain and enhance our competitive position. In the United States, we have
approximately 11,600 granted patents and pending patent applications, of which approximately 3,600
patents have been granted. The vast majority of such patents and patent applications relate to
digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be
relevant to CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA and OFDMA products. We also have and will
continue to actively file for broad patent protection outside the United States. We have
approximately 54,100 foreign granted patents and pending patent applications, of which
approximately 18,500 patents have been granted, that have broad coverage throughout most of the
world, including China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil, India, Taiwan and elsewhere.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G
standards that are based on CDMA. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to
license our essential patents for these CDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from
unfair discrimination. We have also informed standards bodies that we may hold essential
intellectual property rights for certain standards that are based on OFDMA technology (e.g.,
802.16e, 802.16m and LTE).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation.
These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to wireless
technology. Because all commercially deployed forms of CDMA and their derivatives require the use
of our patents, our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed portfolio in the
industry with over 175 licensees. Over the years a number of companies have challenged our patent
position but at this time most, if not all, companies recognize that any company seeking to
develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technologies will require a license or
other rights to use our patents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues and support worldwide adoption of our
CDMA technology, we license to other companies the rights to design, manufacture and sell products
utilizing certain portions of our CDMA intellectual property. Our current publicly announced CDMA
licensees are listed on our Internet site (www.qualcomm.com).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, we have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patented technologies
to interested companies on terms that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair discrimination.
Unlike some other companies in our industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer
interested companies the opportunity to license essentially our entire patent portfolio for use in
cellular devices and cell site infrastructure equipment. Our strategy to broadly make available our
licensed technologies has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of
companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while driving down average and
low-end selling prices for 3G handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise
providing rights to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications,
supporting equipment manufacturers with a total chipset and software solution, and focusing on
improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped 3G CDMA evolve, grow
and reduce device pricing all at a faster pace than the second generation technologies that
preceded it (e.g., GSM).

as ongoing royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of certain
permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.), of subscriber and
infrastructure equipment and/or a fixed per unit amount. License fees are paid in one or more
installments, while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the licensed patents. We
believe that our licensing terms are reasonable and fair to the companies that benefit from our
intellectual property and provide significant incentives for others to invest in CDMA (including
WCDMA) applications, as evidenced by the significant growth in the CDMA portion of the wireless
industry and the number of CDMA participants. Our license agreements generally provide us rights to
use certain of our licensees&#146; technology and intellectual property rights to manufacture and sell
certain products (e.g., Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and related software,
subscriber units and/or infrastructure equipment. In most cases, our use of our licensees&#146;
technology and intellectual property is royalty free. However, under some of the licenses, if we
incorporate certain of the licensed technology or intellectual property into certain products, we
are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this
Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case,
the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information
set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Businesses</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If deployment of our technologies does not expand as expected, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and commercializing CDMA technology
for wireless telecommunications applications. Other digital wireless communications technologies,
particularly GSM technology, have been more widely deployed than CDMA technology. If adoption and
use of CDMA-based wireless communications standards do not continue in the countries where our
products and those of our customers and licensees are sold, our business and financial results
could suffer. If GSM wireless operators do not select CDMA for their networks or upgrade their
current networks to any CDMA-based third-generation (3G) technology, our business and financial
results could suffer since we have not previously generated significant revenues from sales of
single-mode GSM products. In addition to CDMA technology, we continue to invest in developing,
patenting and commercializing OFDMA technology, which has not yet been widely adopted and
commercially deployed, and our MediaFLO technology, which was commercially deployed
in the United States in fiscal 2007. If OFDMA is not widely adopted and commercially deployed
and/or MediaFLO technology is not more widely adopted by consumers in the United States or
commercially deployed internationally, our investments in OFDMA and MediaFLO technologies may not
provide us an adequate return.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business and the deployment of our technologies, products and services are dependent on
the success of our customers, licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators, as well as the timing of
their deployment of new services. Our licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators may incur lower
gross margins on products or services based on our technologies than on products using alternative
technologies as a result of greater competition or other factors. If CDMA-based wireless operators,
wireless device and/or infrastructure manufacturers cease providing CDMA-based products and/or
services, the deployment of CDMA technology could be negatively affected, and our business could
suffer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>We are dependent on the commercial deployment and upgrades of 3G wireless communications equipment,
products and services to increase our revenues, and our business may be harmed if wireless network
operators delay or are unsuccessful in the commercial deployment or upgrade of 3G technology or if
they deploy other technologies.</I>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our revenues in future periods, we are dependent upon the commercial deployment
and upgrades of 3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA
technology. Although wireless network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 and WCDMA, we
cannot predict the timing or success of further commercial deployments or expansions or upgrades of
CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA systems. If existing deployments are not commercially successful or
do not continue to grow their subscriber base, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA
or other CDMA-based systems are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial results may be
harmed. In addition, our business could be harmed if wireless network operators deploy other
technologies or switch existing networks from CDMA to GSM without upgrading to WCDMA or if wireless
network operators introduce new technologies. A limited number of wireless operators have started
testing OFDMA technology, but the timing and extent of OFDMA deployments is uncertain, and we might
not be successful in developing and marketing OFDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Our patent portfolio may not be as successful in generating licensing income with respect to other
technologies as it has been for CDMA-based technologies.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GSM, GPRS,
EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and/or Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO)&nbsp;technologies, our patent portfolio
licensing program in these areas is less established and might not be as successful in generating
licensing income as our CDMA portfolio licensing program. Many wireless operators are investigating
or have selected LTE (or to a lesser extent WiMAX) as next-generation technologies for deployment
in existing or future spectrum bands as complementary to their existing CDMA-based networks.
Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the
LTE and WiMAX standards and have granted royalty-bearing licenses to nine companies to make and
sell products implementing those standards (including Nokia and two other major handset OEMs), we
might not achieve the same royalty revenues on such LTE or WiMAX deployments as on CDMA-based
deployments, and we might not achieve the same level of success in selling LTE or WiMAX products as
we have in CDMA-based products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues and earnings have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate
significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions have caused a downturn in the
market for our products or technology. Despite the recent improvements in market conditions, a
future downturn in the market for our products or technology could adversely affect our operating
results and increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Any
prolonged credit crisis may result in the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays;
delays in reporting and/or payments from our licensees; the inability of our customers to obtain
credit to finance purchases of our products; customer/licensee insolvencies that impact our
customers&#146;/licensees&#146; ability to pay us and/or cause our customers to change delivery schedules,
cancel committed purchase orders or reduce purchase order commitment projections; uncertainty in
global economies, which could impact demand for CDMA-based products in various regions;
counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury operations; and the inability to utilize
federal and/or state capital loss carryovers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volatility in financial markets has impacted, and could continue to impact, the value and
performance of our marketable securities. Net investment income could vary depending on the gains
or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method
investments, impairment charges related to marketable securities and other investments, changes in
interest rates and changes in fair values of derivative instruments. Our cash and marketable
securities investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even
negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial market conditions in fixed
income and equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:
our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or licensees, both domestically and
internationally; our ability to develop, introduce and market new technology, products and services
on a timely basis; management of inventory by us and our customers and their customers in response
to shifts in market demand; changes in the mix of technology and products developed, licensed,
produced and sold; seasonal customer demand; disputes with our customers and licensees; and other
factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report and in these risk factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our
quarterly and/or annual operating results. If our earnings fail to meet the financial guidance we
provide to investors, or the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any period,
securities class action litigation could be brought against us and/or the market price of our
common stock could decline.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect
our revenues and operating results.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the recent improvements in market conditions, a future decline in global economic
conditions could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products
of our customers, particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers or other members of
the wireless industry, such as wireless network operators. We cannot predict other negative events
that may have adverse effects on the economy, on demand for wireless device products or on wireless
device inventories at CDMA-based equipment manufacturers and wireless operators. Inflation and/or
deflation and economic recessions that adversely affect the global economy and capital markets also
adversely affect our customers and our end consumers. For example, our customers&#146; ability to
purchase or pay for our products and services, obtain financing and upgrade wireless networks could
be adversely affected, leading to cancellation or delay of orders for our products. Also, our end
consumers&#146; standards of living could be lowered, and their ability to purchase wireless devices
based on our technology could be diminished. Inflation could also increase our costs of raw
materials and operating expenses and harm our business in other ways, and deflation could reduce
our revenues if product prices fall. Any of these results from worsening global economic conditions
could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2009, 69% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in South
Korea, China and Japan as compared to 70% and 69% during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. These
customers sell their products to markets worldwide, including in Japan, South Korea, China, India,
North America, South America and Europe. A significant downturn in the economies of Asian countries
where many of our customers and licensees are located, particularly the economies of South Korea,
Japan and China, or the economies of the major markets they serve could materially harm our
business. In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military
action in response to this threat, or any future acts of war or terrorism, may cause disruptions to
the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create uncertainties. Should
such negative events occur, subsequent economic recovery might not benefit us in the near term. If
it does not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be
impaired. In addition, because we intend to continue to make significant investments in research
and development and to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability, any
decline in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Our four largest customers accounted for 49% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 42% in fiscal
2008 and 34% in fiscal 2007. The loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the
demand for devices utilizing our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to
achieve or sustain desired levels of operating results.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of any one of our QCT segment&#146;s significant customers or the delay, even if only
temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any of these customers would reduce our
revenues in the period of the cancellation or deferral and harm our ability to achieve or sustain
expected levels of operating results. We derive a significant portion of our QCT segment revenues
from four major customers. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment diversifies and expands
its customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of any
future purchase orders from these customers. Factors that may impact the size and timing of orders
from customers of our QCT segment include, among others, the following:

strategies have included (i)&nbsp;litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such
companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion and patent and license unenforceability, or some form
of unfair competition, (ii)&nbsp;taking questionable positions on the interpretation of contracts with
us, (iii)&nbsp;appeals to governmental authorities, such as the complaints filed with the European
Commission (EC)&nbsp;during the fourth calendar quarter of 2005 and with the Korea Fair Trade Commission
(KFTC)&nbsp;and the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)&nbsp;during 2006, (iv)&nbsp;collective action, including
working with carriers, standards bodies, other like-minded technology companies and other

with governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the imposition of
some form of compulsory licensing and/or to weaken a patent holder&#146;s ability to enforce its rights
or obtain a fair return for such rights. A number of these strategies are purportedly based on
interpretations of the policies of certain standards development organizations concerning the
licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and our alleged failure to
abide by these policies. There is a risk that relevant courts or governmental agencies will
interpret those policies in a manner adverse to our interests.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six companies (Nokia, Ericsson, Panasonic, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and NEC) submitted

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Broadcom have each withdrawn their complaints, the investigation remains active. While the
EC&#146;s actions to date do not indicate that the EC has found any evidence of a violation by us and we
believe that none of our business practices violate the legal requirements of Article&nbsp;82 of the EC
treaty, if the EC determines liability as to any of the alleged violations, it could impose fines
and/or require us to modify our practices. Further, the continuation of this investigation could be
expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention from our business and harm our
reputation. Although such potential adverse findings may be appealed within the EC legal system, an
adverse final determination could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and/or
earnings. Two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and two South Korean companies
(Nextreaming Corp. and Thin Multimedia, Inc.) filed complaints with the KFTC alleging that certain
of our business practices violate South Korean anti-trust regulations. On February&nbsp;17, 2009, the
KFTC issued a Case Examiner&#146;s report setting forth allegations with respect to the lawfulness of
certain business practices related to our integration of multimedia solutions into our chipsets,
rebates and discounts provided to our chipset customers and of certain licensing practices. As a
result of its agreement with us, in May&nbsp;2009 Broadcom withdrew its complaint to the KFTC. Hearings
before the KFTC commenced on May&nbsp;27, 2009, and on July&nbsp;23, 2009, the KFTC announced its ruling in
the case, although the written decision has not yet been issued. The KFTC announced that it found
us to be in violation of South Korean law by offering certain discounts and rebates for purchases
of our CDMA chips and that it would levy a fine of at least 260&nbsp;billion Korean won, as well as
order us to cease the practices at issue. We intend to appeal the written decision once issued. As a result of this announcement, we
recorded a $230&nbsp;million charge during fiscal 2009. We
do not anticipate that the cease and desist remedies ordered will have a material effect on our
operations. In July&nbsp;2009, the KFTC also announced that it would continue its review of our
integration of multimedia functions into our chipsets, but it has not announced any decisions in
that regard. The JFTC has also received unspecified complaints alleging that our business practices
are, in some way, a violation of Japanese law. We have not received the complaints but we have
submitted certain requested information and documents to the JFTC regarding the non-assert,
cross-licensing and royalty provisions in our license agreements and BREW agreements. On September
29, 2009, the JFTC issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO)&nbsp;concluding that our Japanese licensees
were forced to cross-license patents to us on a royalty-free basis and were forced to accept a
provision under which they agreed not to assert their essential patents against our other licensees
who made a similar commitment in their license agreements with us. The CDO seeks to require us to
modify our existing license agreements with Japanese companies to eliminate these provisions while
preserving the license of our patents to those companies. We disagree with the conclusions that we
forced our Japanese licensees to agree to any provision in the parties&#146; agreements and that those
provisions violate Japan&#146;s Anti-Monopoly Act. We intend to invoke our right under Japanese law to
an administrative hearing before the JFTC, request that the JFTC suspend the CDO pending a decision
following the hearing, and seek a stay of the CDO from the Japanese courts should the JFTC deny our
request to suspend the CDO. Rejection of our requests to suspend or stay the CDO or an adverse
final determination following administrative and judicial (if necessary) review of the CDO could
have a significant negative impact on our business, including our revenues and/or earnings. We
believe that none of our business practices violate the legal requirements of South Korean
competition law or Japanese competition law. However, continuation of the KFTC&#146;s investigation and
administrative and judicial review of the KFTC&#146;s written decision and the JFTC&#146;s CDO could be
expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention from our business and harm our
reputation.

vigorously defend our intellectual property and contract rights and our right to continue to
receive a fair return for our innovations, the distractions caused by challenges to our business
model and licensing program are undesirable and the legal and other costs associated with defending
our position have been and continue to be significant. We assume, as should investors, that such
challenges will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial
management time and financial resources to explain and defend our position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our wireless communications
technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent applications relate to our other
technologies and products. We may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights,
protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a
result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property
rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn,
could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights
could impair our brand identity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other
intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other
technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our
involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues
and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found
to infringe on another company&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction
or required to redesign our products, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay
damages or other compensation to such other company. If we were unable to redesign our products,
license such intellectual property rights used in our products or otherwise distribute our products
through a licensed supplier, we could be prohibited from making and selling such products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front
of administrative bodies (such as the U.S. International Trade Commission) to defend against patent
assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive
advantage or negotiating leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful and, if we
are not, the range of possible outcomes includes everything from a royalty payment to an injunction
on the sale of certain of our chipsets (and on the sale of our customers&#146; devices using our
chipsets) and the imposition of royalty payments that might make purchases of our chipsets less
economical for our customers. A negative outcome in any such litigation could severely disrupt the
business of our chipset customers and their wireless customers, which in turn could hurt our
relationships with our chipset customers and wireless operators and could result in a decline in
our share of worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees&#146; sales to wireless
operators, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as the number of competitors or other patent holders in the market increases and
the functionality of our products expands to include additional technologies and features, we may
become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of
others. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly
litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release
or shipment delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results.
In any potential dispute involving other companies&#146; patents or other intellectual property, our
chipset suppliers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently
liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain
customers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of
patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us. Reimbursements under
indemnification arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the business
of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could hurt our
relationships with our chipset customers and wireless operators and could result in a decline in
our chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees&#146; sales to wireless operators, causing a
corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other companies have claimed to own patents essential to various CDMA standards,
GSM standards and OFDMA standards or implementations of OFDM and OFDMA systems. If we or other
product manufacturers are required to obtain additional licenses and/or pay royalties to one or
more patent holders, this could have a material adverse effect on the commercial implementation of
our CDMA, GSM, OFDMA or multimode products and technologies, demand for our licensees&#146; products and
our profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other companies or entities also have, and may again, commence actions seeking to establish

may have more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not currently
deploying CDMA-based wireless communications technology. These competitors also may have
established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our
existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect
our customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or license technology from us or to use alternative
technologies. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly
acquire significant market share of sales to our detriment. In addition to the foregoing, we have
seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop
products, including chipsets, that will operate in an &#147;open source&#148; environment, which offers
practical accessibility to a portion of a product&#146;s source code. Developing open source compliant
products, without imperiling the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business
depends, may prove difficult under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive
disadvantage for new product designs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to believe our FLO TV service offering provides compelling advantages to
consumers. However, we face indirect competition to our FLO TV products and services from wireless
delivery of streaming and downloadable video content via wireless operators, OEMs and other
providers of mobile video content, as well as from internet video content accessed through the
mobile web browser.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to believe our QMT Division&#146;s interferometric modulator (IMOD)&nbsp;displays will
offer compelling advantages to users of displays, there can be no assurance that other technologies
will not continue to improve in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our IMOD
displays. Sales of flat panel displays are currently, and we believe will likely continue to be for
some time, dominated by displays based on liquid crystal display (LCD)&nbsp;technology. Numerous
companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics
of, LCDs. Additionally, several other flat panel display technologies have been, or are being,
developed, including technologies for the production of organic light-emitting diode (OLED), field
emission, inorganic electroluminescence, gas plasma and vacuum fluorescent displays. In each case,
advances in LCD or other flat panel display technologies could result in technologies that are more
cost effective, have fewer display limitations or can be brought to market faster than our IMOD
technology. These advances in competing technologies might cause display manufacturers to avoid
entering into commercial relationships with us, or not renew planned or existing relationships with
us. Our QMT division had $389&nbsp;million in assets (including $128&nbsp;million in goodwill) at September
27, 2009. If we do not achieve adequate market penetration with our IMOD display technology, our
assets may become impaired, which could negatively impact our operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Attempts by certain companies, if successful, to amend or modify Standards Development
Organizations&#146; (SDOs) and other industry forums&#146; intellectual property policies could impact our
licensing business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies
for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations, some of which would require a maximum
aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all essential patents owned by all of
the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant
standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to
each member company with essential patents based upon the number of essential patents held by such
company. In May&nbsp;2007, seven companies (Nokia, Nokia-Siemens, NEC, Ericsson, SonyEricsson,
Alcatel-Lucent and NextWave) issued a press release announcing their commitment to the principles
described above with respect to the licensing of patents essential to LTE and inviting all other
industry participants to join them in adopting such policies. Although the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)&nbsp;IPR Special Committee and the Next Generation Mobile
Network industry group have thus far determined that such proposals should not be adopted as
amendments to existing ETSI policies or new policies, and no other companies have joined these
seven companies, such proposals as described above might be revisited within ETSI and might be
adopted by other SDOs or industry groups, formal and/or informal, resulting in a potential
disadvantage to our business model either by artificially limiting our return on investment with
respect to new technologies or forcing us to work outside of the SDOs or such other industry groups
for promoting our new technologies.

in our product supply source, an inability of our suppliers to react to shifts in product demand or
an increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or
profitability. Component shortages could adversely affect our ability and that of our customers to
ship products on a timely basis and, as a result, our customers&#146; demand for our products. Any such
shipment delays or declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain desired levels of profitability. Additionally, failure to meet customer demand in a timely
manner could damage our reputation and harm our customer relationships. Our operations may also be
harmed by lengthy or recurring disruptions at any of our suppliers&#146; manufacturing facilities and by
disruptions in the distribution channels from our suppliers and to our customers. Any such
disruptions could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products
from an affected manufacturer to another manufacturer. If the affected supplier was a sole-source
supplier, we may not be able to obtain the product without significant cost and delay. The loss of
a significant third-party supplier or the inability of a third-party supplier to meet performance

these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments, except as may be provided in a
particular purchase order that has been accepted by our supplier. To the extent that we do not have
firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period, or in any specific quantity, our
suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of
products for their other customers while reducing capacity to manufacture our products.
Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or available at
reasonable prices. We have experienced capacity limitations from our suppliers, which resulted in
supply constraints and our inability to meet certain customer demand. There can be no assurance
that we will not experience these or other supply constraints in the future, which could result in
our failure to meet customer demand.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our goal is to establish alternate suppliers for technologies that we consider critical,
some of our integrated circuits products are only available from single sources, with which we do
not have long-term capacity commitments. Our reliance on sole- or limited-source suppliers involves
significant risks including possible shortages of manufacturing capacity, poor product performance
and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality
assurance, quantity and costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may oblige us to incur costs to
manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to
our customers which may result in lowering our operating margins. In addition, the timely readiness
of our foundry suppliers to support transitions to smaller geometry process technologies could
impact our ability to meet customer demand, revenues and cost expectations. The timing of
acceptance of the smaller technology designs by our customers may subject us to the risk of excess
inventories of earlier designs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a loss of, or a decision to change, a key third-party supplier, qualifying a
new foundry supplier and commencing volume production or testing could involve delay and expense,
resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating margins and possible loss of customers. We work
closely with our customers to expedite their processes for evaluating new integrated circuits from
our foundry suppliers; however, in some instances, transition of integrated circuit production to a
new foundry supplier may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific integrated circuits to
individual customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we engage in acquisitions or strategic transactions or make investments
with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures or
other strategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities, including minority interests
in publicly-traded and private companies, non-investment-grade debt securities, equity and debt
mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds/notes, auction rate securities and
mortgage/asset-backed securities. Many of our strategic investments are in early-stage companies to
support our business, including the global adoption of CDMA-based technologies and related
services. Most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid
until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. Our acquisitions or strategic
investments (either those we have completed or may undertake in the future) may not generate
financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In
addition, our other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to
market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. In some cases,
we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies.
Our share of any losses will adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce
our exposure to these investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to
integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of
companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we
may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. The difficulties of
integrating companies include, among others:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only

critical functions in our customers&#146; products and/or networks, such defects or errors could have a
serious impact on our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships

our ability, and that of our customers and licensees, to ship products on a timely basis as well as
customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or declines in demand could

product liability insurance to protect against product liability claims, we cannot assure you that
our insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect us against losses due to product liability
claims, or that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost.
Furthermore, not all losses associated with alleged product failure are insurable. Our inability to
maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to protect ourselves in other ways against potential
product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and those
of our licensees and customers and harm our future operating results. In addition, a product

partners to price, market and otherwise promote our service to their end users. If our wireless

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer acceptance of our FLO TV and Firethorn service offerings are, and will continue to
be, affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance, quality,
reliability and coverage of our wireless network and services platforms. Consumer demand could be
impacted by differences in technology, coverage and service areas, network quality, consumer
perceptions, program and service offerings and rate plans. Our wireless operator and financial
services partners may have difficulty retaining subscribers if we are unable to meet subscriber
expectations for network quality and coverage, customer care, content or security. Obtaining
content for our FLO TV business that is appealing to subscribers on economically feasible terms may
be limited by our content provider partners&#146; inability to obtain the mobile rights to such
programming. An inability to address these issues could limit our ability to expand our subscriber
base placing us at a competitive disadvantage, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Additionally, adoption and deployment of our MediaFLO technology could be adversely impacted by
government regulatory practices that support a single standard other than our technology, wireless
operator selection of competing technologies or consumer preferences. If MediaFLO technology is not
more widely adopted by consumers in the United States or commercially deployed internationally, our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are required to estimate and record compensation expense in the statement of operations for
share-based payments, such as employee stock options, using the fair value method. This method has
a significant effect on our reported earnings, although it will not affect our cash flows, and
could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial
results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the values of share-based payments.
If factors change and/or we employ different assumptions or different valuation methods in future
periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from amounts recorded
previously, which could negatively affect our stock price and our stock price volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we
will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in
future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share-based payments. It may also
result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and
assumptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical valuation models and market-based methods are evolving and may result in lower or
higher fair value estimates for share-based compensation. The timing, readiness, adoption, general
acceptance, reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain. Sophisticated mathematical
models may require voluminous historical information, modeling expertise, financial analyses,
correlation analyses, integrated software and databases, consulting fees, customization and testing
for adequacy of internal controls. Market-based methods are emerging that, if employed by us, may
dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative
expenses. The uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the

In such case, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods

adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For
example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash

United States federal and state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future reported financial results may be

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that
utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators
must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in
the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated
to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital
required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies; deploy wireless networks to offer voice and
data services; expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services; and obtain new
subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow
the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional
capital necessary to implement or expand 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely
affected if this occurs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect
of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our products and those
of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have
updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio
equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health
concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also
been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the
use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these
expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and
customers in the United States as well as foreign countries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our board members, executive
officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability
to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our
product and business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our revenues
are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for such specialized
engineering and other talented employees in our industry is extremely competitive. In addition,
existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled
foreign national graduates of U.S. universities, making the pool of available talent even smaller.
Key employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these employees is intense in
the wireless communications industry. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of an
unfavorable change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty
attracting and retaining qualified employees. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource
needs, particularly in engineering. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified employees
that we need, our business may be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in periods of poor
operating performance given the significant use of incentive compensation by our competitors. We do
not have employment agreements with our key management personnel and do not maintain key person
life insurance on any of our personnel. To the extent that new regulations make it less attractive
to grant share-based awards to employees or if stockholders do not authorize shares for the
continuation of equity compensation programs in the future, we may incur increased compensation
costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate
employees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations
and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application
in practice may evolve over time. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate
governance and public disclosure. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal
requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and
procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance
activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ
from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to
practice, our reputation might also be harmed. Further,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Our charter documents and Delaware law could limit transactions in which stockholders might obtain
a premium over current market prices.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that requires the approval of holders of
at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock as a condition to certain mergers or other business
transactions with, or proposed by, a holder of 15% or more of our voting stock. Under our charter
documents, stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings of our stockholders or to act by
written consent. These charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an
actual or potential change in our control, including those offering stockholders a premium over
current market prices. These provisions may also limit our stockholders&#146; ability to approve
transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, our Board of Directors has the authority under Delaware law to fix the rights and
preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock, and our preferred share purchase rights
agreement will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to
acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. While our Board of Directors approved
our preferred share purchase rights agreement to provide the board with greater ability to maximize
shareholder value, these rights could deter takeover attempts that the board finds inadequate and
make it more difficult to bring about a change in our ownership.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>European Commission Complaint: </I>On October&nbsp;28, 2005, it was reported that six companies
(Broadcom, Nokia, Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the
European Commission, alleging that we violated European Union competition law in our WCDMA
licensing practices. We have received the complaints and have submitted replies to the allegations,
as well as documents and other information requested by the European Commission. On October&nbsp;1,
2007, the European Commission announced that it had initiated a proceeding. To date, the European
Commission has not announced whether it would issue a Statement of Objections or whether it has
made any conclusions as to the merits of the complaints. As part of their agreements with us, Nokia
and Broadcom have each withdrawn their complaints filed with the European Commission, though the
investigation remains active.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tessera, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On April&nbsp;17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. filed a patent
infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas and a
complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)&nbsp;pursuant to Section&nbsp;337 of
the Tariff Act of 1930 against us and other companies, alleging infringement of two patents
relating to semiconductor packaging structures and seeking monetary damages and injunctive and
other relief. The District Court action is stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. The
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#146;s (USPTO)&nbsp;Central Reexamination Unit has issued office actions
rejecting all of the asserted patent claims on the grounds that they are invalid in view of certain
prior art and has made these rejections final; Tessera has appealed the rejections to the Board of
Patent Appeals and Interferences. On December&nbsp;1, 2008, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;ruled
that the patents are valid but not infringed. On May&nbsp;20, 2009, however, the ITC reversed the ALJ&#146;s
determination that the patents were not infringed and it issued the following remedial orders: (1)
a limited exclusion order that bans us and the other named respondents from importing into the
United States the accused chip packages (except to the extent those products are licensed) and (2)
a cease and desist order that prohibits us from engaging in certain domestic activities respecting
those products. We and other respondents have appealed. The ITC declined to stay its decision
pending appeal, and the President declined to review the decision.  We have shifted supply of
accused chips for the U.S. market to a licensed supplier, Amkor. A licensed source of supply
permits us to continue to supply the U.S. market without interruption. The appeals court has
declined our request that it stay enforcement of the orders pending appeal. The subject patents
expire on September&nbsp;24, 2010, at which time the ITC orders will cease to be operative.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint: </I>Two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and
two South Korean companies (Nextreaming Corp. and Thin Multimedia, Inc.) filed complaints with the
Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC)&nbsp;alleging that certain of our business practices violate South
Korean anti-trust regulations. On February&nbsp;17, 2009, the KFTC issued a Case Examiner&#146;s report
setting forth allegations with respect to the lawfulness of certain business practices related to
our integration of multimedia solutions into our chipsets, rebates and discounts provided to our
chipset customers and of certain licensing practices. As a result of its agreement with us, in May
2009 Broadcom withdrew its complaint to the KFTC. Hearings before the KFTC commenced on May&nbsp;27,
2009, and on July&nbsp;23, 2009 the KFTC announced its ruling, although the written decision has not yet
been issued. The KFTC announced that it found us to be in violation of South Korean law by offering
certain discounts and rebates for purchases of our CDMA chips and that it would levy a fine of at
least 260&nbsp;billion Korean won, as well as order us to cease the practices at issue. Subject to the
issuance and review of the KFTC&#146;s written decision, we intend to appeal the decision. As
a result of this announcement, we recorded a
$230&nbsp;million charge during fiscal 2009. We do not
anticipate that the cease and desist remedies ordered will have a material effect on our
operations. In July&nbsp;2009, the KFTC also announced that it would continue its review of our
integration of multimedia functions into our chipsets, but it has not announced any decision in
that regard. We believe that our practices do not violate South Korean competition law, are
grounded in sound business practice and are consistent with our customers&#146; desires.

unspecified complaints alleging that our business practices are, in some way, a violation of
Japanese law. On September&nbsp;29, 2009, the JFTC issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO)&nbsp;concluding that
our Japanese licensees were forced to cross-
license patents to us on a royalty-free basis and were forced to accept a provision under
which they agreed not to
assert their essential patents against our other licensees who made a similar commitment in
their license agreements with us. The CDO seeks to require us to modify our existing license
agreements with Japanese companies to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">eliminate these provisions while preserving the license of
our patents to those companies. We disagree with the conclusions that we forced our Japanese
licensees to agree to any provision in the parties&#146; agreements and that those provisions violate
Japan&#146;s Anti-Monopoly Act. We intend to invoke our right under Japanese law to an administrative
hearing before the JFTC, request that the JFTC suspend the CDO pending a decision following the
hearing, and seek a stay of the CDO from the Japanese courts should the JFTC deny our request to
suspend the CDO.

operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action lawsuits,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On August 5, 2009, Panasonic filed an arbitration demand alleging that it does not owe royalties,
or owes less royalties, on its WCDMA subscriber units, and that we breached the license
agreement between us as well as certain commitments to standards setting organizations. The
arbitration demand seeks declaratory relief regarding the amount of royalties due and payable by
Panasonic, as well as the return of certain royalties it had previously paid. We have responded to
the arbitration demand, denying the allegations and requesting judgment in our favor on all
claims. Although we believe Panasonic&#146;s claims are without merit, we have deferred the
recognition of revenue related to WCDMA subscriber unit royalties reported and paid by
Panasonic in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 because, among other reasons, the matter has been
submitted to arbitration for resolution.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2008, a complaint was filed in San Diego Federal Court on behalf of a purported
class of individuals who purchased CDMA devices or service, seeking damages and injunctive relief
under federal and/or state antitrust and unfair competition laws and common law as a result of our
licensing practices. On March&nbsp;3, 2009, the court granted our motion and dismissed the complaint. On
April&nbsp;2, 2009, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint re-asserting some, but not all, of the
claims in its original complaint. On August&nbsp;10, 2009, the court granted our motion to dismiss the
amended complaint for lack of standing. However, the court may reopen the case in the event an
appeals court reverses a decision in an unrelated case involving different parties but raising a
similar standing issue.

than the amount relating to the <I>Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint</I>, we have not recorded any
accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on
our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible
range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in numerous other legal
actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance,
believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results, liquidity or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;2, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock,
payable on December&nbsp;23, 2009 to stockholders of record as of November&nbsp;25, 2009. We intend to
continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations
that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected
by, among other items, our views on potential future capital
requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of
sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase
programs, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We primarily issue stock options under our share-based compensation plans, which are part of a
broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees
and directors and align stockholder and employee interests.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2006 Plan), we grant options to selected
employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less
than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant
of both incentive and non-qualified stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards.
Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for
up to ten years from the grant date. The Board of Directors may terminate the 2006 Plan at any
time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information regarding our stock option plans and plan activity for fiscal 2009,
2008 and 2007 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 &#151; Employee Benefit Plans&#148; and in our
2010 Proxy Statement under the heading &#147;Equity Compensation Plan Information.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;11, 2008, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $2.0&nbsp;billion
of our common stock with no expiration date. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion
remained authorized for repurchase. While we did not repurchase any of our shares during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009, we continue to evaluate repurchases under this program.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following graph compares total stockholder return on our common stock since September&nbsp;26,
2004 to two indices: the Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s 500 Stock Index (the S&#038;P 500) and the Nasdaq Total
Return Index for Communications Equipment Stocks, SIC 3660-3669 (the Nasdaq Industry). The S&#038;P 500
tracks the aggregate price performance of the equity securities of 500 United States companies
selected by Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Index Committee to include companies in leading industries and to
reflect the United States stock market. The NASDAQ Industry tracks the aggregate price performance
of equity securities of communications equipment companies traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The
total return for our stock and for each index assumes the reinvestment of dividends and is based on
the returns of the component companies weighted according to their capitalizations as of the end of
each annual period. We began paying dividends on our common stock on March&nbsp;31, 2003. Our common
stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is a component of each of the S&#038;P 500 and
the NASDAQ Industry.

    <TD>Both revenues and net income were adversely impacted by lower demand for CDMA-based
MSM integrated circuits during the first half of fiscal 2009 as a result of the slowdown
in the global economy. We shipped approximately 317&nbsp;million Mobile Station Modem (MSM)
integrated circuits for CDMA-based wireless devices, a decrease of 6%, compared to
approximately 336&nbsp;million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2008. In addition, net
income was adversely impacted by other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities
related primarily to the volatility in global financial markets.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm
CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless &#038; Internet, or
QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system
products. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices,
particularly mobile phones, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers, data cards and
infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless devices include the Mobile Station
Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF)&nbsp;and Power Management (PM)&nbsp;devices. These integrated circuits for
wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global
positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. QCT&#146;s
system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit
products and is the foundation software enabling equipment manufacturers to develop devices
utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated
circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless
operator&#146;s base station equipment. QCT revenues comprised 59%, 60% and 59% of total consolidated
revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate
foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test
manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing
and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also
responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our
integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase
our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully
assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we
purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party
manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing
business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD
(including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives
license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products
incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or
more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling
price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs,
packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 35%, 33% and 31% of total consolidated revenues
in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues have been generated
through our licensees&#146; sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS),
Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV)&nbsp;and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile
information products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery
of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and
other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce. Through September&nbsp;2009, QES
has shipped approximately 1,344,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based mobile information units.
QIS provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including BREW (Binary Runtime
Environment for Wireless), the Plaza suite and other services. QIS also provides QChat
push-to-talk, QPoint and other products for wireless network operators. The QGOV division provides
development, hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to
United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable
financial institutions and wireless operators to offer mobile commerce services. QWI revenues
comprised 6%, 7% and 9% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSI manages the Company&#146;s strategic investment activities, including FLO TV Incorporated (FLO
TV), formerly MediaFLO USA, Inc., our wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI
also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and
services. Our strategy is to invest in early-stage and other companies, including licensed device
manufacturers, that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and
introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including
assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By
their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that
differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and
financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions
may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related
hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services
and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue recognition and the
amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the
specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations.
Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that
we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions
to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other
volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are based on estimates, including our
assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and inventory
levels.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties
based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License
fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen
years. We earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that
the licensees&#146; sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales
in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. We recognize royalty revenues
based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition
criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal
disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. </I></B>Our business acquisitions typically result in
the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may
become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. As
of September&nbsp;27, 2009, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were
$1.5&nbsp;billion and $3.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible
assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial
statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary
exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the
estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish
their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets
transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation
techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to
measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require
significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to
the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing
and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our
estimate of the fair value of certain assets, or our conclusion that
the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable, may differ materially from that determined by others
who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in
the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates
in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows
related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market
conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process,
the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market
penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or
their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge
on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the
occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our
reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist
and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired
businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our net
investment income (loss).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly
volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment-grade
debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds and notes,
auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These investments, which are
recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders&#146; equity
as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $15&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;27, 2009. We record
impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has
experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than
temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our
strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to
significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments,
thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary
decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in
value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been
below its original cost, the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default
or recovery rates of securities in an asset class, negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a
need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others, the performance and
pricing of the investee&#146;s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the
industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the
financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial
difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record
an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal
2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded $743&nbsp;million, $502&nbsp;million and $16&nbsp;million, respectively, in net
other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Share-Based Payments. </I></B>We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and
directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our
common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each
six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation expense
recognized during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $584&nbsp;million, $543&nbsp;million and $493&nbsp;million,
respectively. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to
non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.4&nbsp;billion, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3&nbsp;years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and
cancellations, granted during fiscal 2009 represented 2.2% of outstanding shares as of the
beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2009 represented 2.5% of
outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial
option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but
are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved
when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation. Option-pricing models were
developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging
restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments
have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because
valuation model assumptions are subjective, in our opinion, existing valuation models, including
the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values
of our share-based compensation awards. There is not currently a generally accepted market-based
mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates
stemming from these valuation models. Although we estimate the fair value of employee share-based
awards, the option-pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair
value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009, we used
the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption
input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two
years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the
expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility
assumption was 42.7% for fiscal 2009, which if increased to 50%, would increase the
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.78 per
share, or 11%. The authoritative guidance includes implied volatility in its list of factors that
should be considered in estimating
expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility
in estimating expected

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for
a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The
weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 2.6% for fiscal 2009, which if increased to
6.0% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2009 by $1.42 per share, or 8%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are
required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield
assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield
assumption was 1.5% for fiscal 2009, which if decreased to 0.4% would increase the weighted-average
estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.14 per share, or 7%.
Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our Board
of Directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance,
stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our
historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial
change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash
distributions that will be made to investors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation
information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 9.2% for fiscal 2009,
which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock
options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.20 per share, or 7%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The
weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.9 for fiscal 2009, which if increased
to 2.5, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2009 by $1.21 per share or 7%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The
second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions
taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any
future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust
the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts
that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions
supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those
which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For
example, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $155&nbsp;million, adjusting our prior
year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of various federal, state and foreign tax
audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing
of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning
strategies. As of September&nbsp;27, 2009, gross deferred tax assets were $1.5&nbsp;billion. If we are unable
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a
material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable
or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;27, 2009, we had gross deferred tax assets of $510&nbsp;million related to capital
losses and $23&nbsp;million related to foreign and state net operating losses. We can only use realized
capital losses to offset realized capital gains. Based upon our assessments of when capital gains
and losses will be realized, we estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to
utilize all of the temporary and other-than-temporary capital losses that were recorded through
fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, we decreased our valuation allowance for the portion of capital
losses we do not expect to utilize by $79&nbsp;million to $55&nbsp;million. This decrease was comprised of a
$278&nbsp;million net decrease in valuation allowance as a result of an increase in net unrealized gains
on marketable securities, which was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive income,
partially offset by a $199&nbsp;million net
increase in valuation allowance related to other-than-temporary impairments on investments,
which was recognized

certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of projected future
taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the
future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize
the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2009. Therefore, we have provided a $17
million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to
forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains, the timing of realization of capital losses
and the amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation
allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses, capital gains and taxable income are

tax liability of approximately $3.0&nbsp;billion related to the United States federal and state income
taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $8.6&nbsp;billion of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to
repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we
determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.

realized by us upon an employee&#146;s disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax
asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit
relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow the tax law ordering method,
under which current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net
operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.

effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without
merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to
pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate
of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range
of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability
related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential
liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating
to the <I>Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint</I>, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent
liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional
liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be

$7.16&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in revenues from sales of equipment and services was
primarily due to a $597&nbsp;million reduction in revenues from sales of integrated circuit products,
mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, caused by the contraction
in CDMA-based channel inventory, and a $79&nbsp;million decrease in QES revenues. Revenues from
licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2009 were $3.95&nbsp;billion, compared to $3.98&nbsp;billion for fiscal

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities related primarily to depressed
securities values caused by the prolonged disruption in global financial markets affecting
consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a
deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of
capital and demand for debt and equity securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense was $484&nbsp;million for fiscal 2009, compared to $666
million for fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate was 23% for fiscal 2009, compared to 17% for
fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 is higher than the annual effective tax
rate for fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United
States federal rate, an increase in the valuation allowance on capital losses recognized in
earnings and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law,
partially offset by adjustments to prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of
tax audits during fiscal 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 of 23% is less than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 7% related to adjustments to prior year estimates of
uncertain tax positions as a result of tax audits during the year and 5% related to research and
development tax credits, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance related to capital
losses of 11%, the revaluation of net deferred items of 4% and state taxes of approximately 5%.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenues. </I></B>Total revenues for fiscal 2008 were $11.14&nbsp;billion, compared to $8.87&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2007. Revenues from two customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted
for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 30% and 27%
in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2008 were $7.16&nbsp;billion, compared to
$5.77&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was
primarily due to a $1.41&nbsp;billion increase in revenues from sales of integrated circuit products,
mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits. Revenues from licensing
and royalty fees for fiscal 2008 were $3.98&nbsp;billion, compared to $3.11&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007. The
increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of
CDMA-based products reported by QTL&#146;s licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption
of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In
addition, revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560&nbsp;million (attributable
to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to agreements with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and
royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products
through April&nbsp;9, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2008 was
$3.41&nbsp;billion compared to $2.68&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues as
a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 48% for fiscal 2008, compared to 47% for fiscal
2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $39&nbsp;million in share-based compensation in
both fiscal 2008 and 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2008, research and development expenses were
$2.28&nbsp;billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.83&nbsp;billion or 21% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The
dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $358&nbsp;million increase in costs related to the
development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the
expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration
of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of
wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode,
multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The
technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO
Revision B, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA&#043; and OFDMA. Research and development expenses related to the
development of our MediaFLO technology, MediaFLO MDS, IMOD display products using MEMS technology,
BREW products and mobile commerce applications increased by $63&nbsp;million. Research and development
expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development
of $250&nbsp;million and $14&nbsp;million, respectively, compared to $221&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million,
respectively, in fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2008, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $1.71&nbsp;billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.48&nbsp;billion or 17% of
revenues for fiscal 2007. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $137&nbsp;million increase
in employee-related expenses and a $72&nbsp;million increase in certain professional fees, primarily
related to patent activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 included
share-based compensation of $254&nbsp;million, compared to $233&nbsp;million in fiscal 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in interest and dividend income on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities held by corporate and other segments was primarily a result of lower interest rates
earned on interest-bearing securities. Other-than-temporary losses in fiscal 2008 included $327
million recognized in the fourth quarter on marketable securities held by corporate and other
segments. Both other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and the decrease in net
realized gains on corporate investments were generally related to depressed securities values
caused by the major disruption in global financial markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense was $666&nbsp;million for fiscal 2008, compared to $323
million for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate was 17% for fiscal 2008, compared to 9% for
fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is higher than the annual effective tax
rate for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is 18% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 22% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, and 1% related to research and development tax credits,
partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4% and 1% related to an increase in the valuation
allowance.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2009 and 2008 financial results
for each reporting segment. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; Note 10 &#151; Segment
Information.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QCT Segment. </I></B>QCT revenues for fiscal 2009 were $6.14&nbsp;billion, compared to $6.72&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2008. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF
and PM integrated circuits, were $5.93&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2009, compared to $6.53&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2008. The decrease in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $770&nbsp;million
decrease related to lower unit shipments, caused by the contraction in CDMA-based channel
inventory. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $113&nbsp;million related to the net
effects of changes in product mix and the average selling prices of such products. Approximately
317&nbsp;million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2009, compared to approximately 336
million for fiscal 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $1.44&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.83&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2008. QCT operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was
23% in fiscal 2009, compared to 27% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating margin percentage was
primarily due to increased research and development expenses while revenues declined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT inventories decreased by 10% in fiscal 2009 from $453&nbsp;million to $408&nbsp;million primarily
due to the net effects of changes in integrated circuit product mix and a decrease in average unit
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QTL Segment. </I></B>QTL revenues for fiscal 2009 were $3.61&nbsp;billion, compared to $3.62&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2008. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $3.07&nbsp;billion, compared to $3.14
billion for fiscal 2008. QTL operating margin percentage was 85% in fiscal 2009, compared to 87% in
fiscal 2008. The decrease in earnings before taxes
was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization related to acquired patents,
partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to litigation and other legal matters,
which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $641&nbsp;million, compared to $785&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2008. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $79&nbsp;million decrease in QES revenues and a $71
million decrease in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $50
million decrease in revenues from hardware product sales, due to a 47,500-unit reduction, or 52%,
in the number of units shipped, and a $21&nbsp;million decrease in messaging revenue. The decrease in
QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $45&nbsp;million decrease in QChat revenues resulting
primarily from decreased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint and a $30
million decrease in BREW revenues resulting from lower consumer demand and lower prices due to the
slowdown in global economies and competitive pricing pressures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 was $20&nbsp;million, compared to a loss before taxes of
$1&nbsp;million for fiscal 2008. QWI operating margin percentage was 3% in fiscal 2009, compared to zero
percent in fiscal 2008. The increase in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to a
decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses at
QIS and QES, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn. The increase in
QWI operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to improvements in QIS and QES gross
margin percentage, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QSI Segment</I></B>. QSI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $29&nbsp;million, compared to $12&nbsp;million for fiscal
2008. QSI loss before taxes for fiscal 2009 was $361&nbsp;million, compared to $304&nbsp;million for fiscal
2008. QSI revenues are attributable to our FLO TV subsidiary. QSI loss before taxes increased by
$57&nbsp;million primarily due to a $39&nbsp;million increase in net investment losses (unrelated to FLO TV)
and an $18&nbsp;million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary&#146;s loss before taxes.

fiscal 2007. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM
integrated circuits, were $6.53&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2008, compared to $5.12&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007.
The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from an increase of $1.23
billion related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $219&nbsp;million related to the net effects
of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 336&nbsp;million
MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 253&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2007.

fiscal 2007. QCT operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was
27% in fiscal 2008, compared to 29% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating margin percentage was
primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage related to an increase in reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory and product support costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT inventories increased by 17% in fiscal 2008 from $387&nbsp;million to $453&nbsp;million primarily
due to the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM and the related work-in
process which includes purchased die and related back-end assembly and test manufacturing services
needed to complete QCT integrated circuit products. The increase is also attributable to an
increase in finished goods associated with growth in sales volume.

fiscal 2007. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $3.14&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.34
billion for fiscal 2007. QTL operating margin percentage was 87% in fiscal 2008, compared to 84% in
fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an
increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL licensees other than Nokia, driven by the
continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. In addition, QTL revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560
million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to the new agreement with Nokia.
Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for
sales of Nokia products through April&nbsp;9, 2007. The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily
attributable to the increase in revenues and the effect of bad debt expenses recognized in fiscal
2007, partially offset by increases in research and development expenses and patent costs, which
resulted in a corresponding increase in operating margin percentage.

offset by a $27&nbsp;million
increase in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to an $88
million decrease in revenues from product sales, partially offset by an $11&nbsp;million increase in
messaging revenues. QES shipped approximately 91,200 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems
during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems

to 11% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily due to the decrease
in revenues, a $30&nbsp;million increase in QIS research and development expenses related to our BREW
products and a $34&nbsp;million increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of
Firethorn during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, all of which contributed to a corresponding
decline in operating margin percentage.

included a $71&nbsp;million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary&#146;s loss before taxes comprised primarily of
an increase of $50&nbsp;million in cost of equipment and services revenues and a $22&nbsp;million increase in
research and development expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our
stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
were $17.7&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;27, 2009, an increase of $6.5&nbsp;billion from September&nbsp;28, 2008. Our
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September&nbsp;27, 2009 consisted of $7.9&nbsp;billion
held domestically with the remaining balance of $9.8&nbsp;billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Due to
tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and
investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities increased to $7.2
billion during fiscal 2009, compared to $3.6&nbsp;billion during fiscal 2008 primarily due to collection
of a $2.5&nbsp;billion licensing receivable paid in October&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2009, we repurchased and retired 8,920,000 shares of our common stock for $284
million. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion remained authorized for repurchases
under our stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. We intend
to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program subject to capital
availability and periodic determinations that such repurchases are in the best interest of our
stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We declared and paid dividends totaling $1.1&nbsp;billion, $982&nbsp;million and $862&nbsp;million, or $0.66,
$0.60 and $0.52 per common share, during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On October&nbsp;2,
2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, payable on December&nbsp;23,
2009 to stockholders of record as of November&nbsp;25, 2009. We intend to continue to pay quarterly
dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in
the best interest of our stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September&nbsp;2007, there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that
has contributed to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic
recession. This period of economic weakness has impacted the value of our marketable securities. At
September&nbsp;27, 2009, gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were $870&nbsp;million and gross
unrealized losses were $196&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, we concluded that the unrealized losses
were temporary. Our relative weighting of these factors is reassessed when market or economic
conditions change. Further, for equity securities, equity mutual and exchange-traded funds and debt
mutual funds with unrealized losses, we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities
until they recover, which is expected to be within a reasonable period of time. For debt securities
with unrealized losses, we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we
will be required to sell, such securities. As a result, we do not believe the decline in the fair
value of our marketable securities will materially affect our liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable decreased by 83% during fiscal 2009 primarily due to collection of a $2.5
billion licensing receivable, partial payment of amounts receivable for redemptions of money market
funds and reclassification of the remaining net balance of these investment receivables to other
assets, and a decrease of approximately $580&nbsp;million in other accounts receivable. Days sales
outstanding related to these other accounts receivable were 23&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;27, 2009 compared
to 34&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;28, 2008. The decrease in other trade accounts receivable and the related
days sales outstanding were primarily due to the timing of cash receipts related to sales of
integrated circuits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash
flow generated from operations, in addition to our substantial untapped debt capacity, will provide
us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal
year and beyond based on our current business plans. Our total research and development
expenditures were $2.4&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2009 and $2.3&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2008, and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;revised the authoritative
guidance for business combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer in a business combination (i)&nbsp;recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree, (ii)&nbsp;recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain
from a bargain purchase and (iii)&nbsp;determines what information to disclose to enable
users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal 2010 beginning September&nbsp;28, 2009 and
will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis.

assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. We adopted the
provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective September&nbsp;29, 2008 but

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB ratified the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF)&nbsp;that revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple
deliverables. The guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should
be allocated among the separate units of accounting. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal
2011 beginning September&nbsp;27, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied
retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. We are in the process
of evaluating early prospective adoption and determining the effects, if any, the adoption of the
guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB also ratified the final consensus reached by the EITF that
modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a)&nbsp;non-software
components of tangible products and (b)&nbsp;software components of tangible products that are sold,
licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components
of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product&#146;s essential
functionality. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal 2011 beginning September&nbsp;27, 2010 with
early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or
materially modified arrangements. We are in the process of evaluating early prospective adoption
and determining the effects, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Credit Market Risk. </I></B>Since September&nbsp;2007, there has been a prolonged disruption in global
financial markets that has led to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global
economic recession. This period of economic weakness has impacted the value of most types of
investment- and non-investment-grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed
securities. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in
diversified portfolios of fixed- and floating-rate, investment-grade marketable securities,
mortgage- and asset-backed securities, non-investment-grade bank loans and bonds, preferred stocks
and other securities that have been affected by these credit market concerns and had temporary
gross unrealized losses of $39&nbsp;million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be
temporary, there is a risk that we may incur net other-than-temporary impairment charges or
realized losses on the values of these and other similarly affected securities if U.S. credit and
equity markets do not stabilize and recover to previous levels in the coming quarters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Rate Risk. </I></B>We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment- and
non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable
debt securities and debt mutual funds. We deposit our cash primarily with one major institution.
Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and
yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise
rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. As
interest rates in the general economy have dropped significantly over the past several months, our
floating interest-bearing securities are earning less interest income. When the general economy
weakens significantly, as it has recently, the credit profile, financial strength and growth
prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may
deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than
temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and
risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average
yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities
are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation
purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Price Risk. </I></B>The prolonged disruption in global financial markets has caused
increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual and
exchange-traded fund shares. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes
equities held by mutual and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We
have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry
and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our
investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity
mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September&nbsp;27, 2009 would cause a decrease in the
carrying amounts of these securities of $247&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, gross unrealized
losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares were
approximately $157&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Foreign Exchange Risk. </I></B>We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency
forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial instruments
are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading
purposes. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, we had a net liability of $28&nbsp;million related to foreign currency
option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from
certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products. Counterparties to our
derivative contracts are all major institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or
distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle
transactions, which could materially impact our results. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to
decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged
foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $19&nbsp;million resulting from a decrease in
the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 &#151; The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies&#148;
for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the
functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may
affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency
exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could
experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as
economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain
transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may,
if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more
expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.

financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f). Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework</I>
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework</I>, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September&nbsp;27,

financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of
human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated
and its subsidiaries at September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended September&nbsp;27, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item&nbsp;15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September&nbsp;27, 2009, based on criteria
established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications,
multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device and infrastructure
manufacturers. The Company also manufactures and sells products based upon Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)&nbsp;technology. The Company grants licenses to use portions of its
intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in
the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, and receives license fees as well as ongoing
royalties based on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications equipment products
incorporating its patented technologies. The Company sells equipment, software and services to
transportation and other companies to wireless connect their assets and workforce. The Company
provides software products and services for content enablement across a wide variety of platforms
and devices for the wireless industry. The Company provides services to wireless operators to
delivery multimedia content, including live television, in the United States. The Company also
makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for
wireless voice and internet data communications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Principles of Consolidation. </I></B>The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the
assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership of the
other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not
significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements one
month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it hold a significant
variable interest in, any variable interest entity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Financial Statement Preparation. </I></B>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements
were issued on November&nbsp;4, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Fiscal Year. </I></B>The Company operates and reports using a 52-53&nbsp;week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008 both
included 52&nbsp;weeks. The fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 included 53&nbsp;weeks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>The Company derives revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, royalties and license fees for its intellectual property, messaging and other services
and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software
hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue
recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of
factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of the Company&#146;s
deliverables and obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company allocates revenue for transactions that include multiple elements to each unit of
accounting based on its relative fair value and recognizes revenue for each unit of accounting when
revenue recognition criteria have been met. The price charged when the element is sold separately
generally determines fair value. When the Company has objective evidence of the fair values of
undelivered elements but not delivered elements, the Company allocates revenue first to the fair
value of the undelivered elements, and the residual revenue is then allocated to the delivered
elements. If the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement
cannot be objectively determined, revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or services
have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining
undelivered elements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of the Company&#146;s products are recognized at the time of shipment, or when
title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if
later. Revenues from providing services, including software hosting services and the delivery of
multimedia content, are recognized when earned.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain
wireless products. Licensees typically pay a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products
incorporating or using the Company&#146;s licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized
over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen years. The Company
earns royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by its licensees at the time that the
licensees&#146; sales occur. The Company&#146;s licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for
sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. The Company recognizes
royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue
recognition criteria are met.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from long-term contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Revenues
and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit
estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of contract
profit would be required. Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met and, if applicable,
when vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of
multiple-element software arrangements, including post-contract customer support. Post-contract
support is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract. When contracts contain
multiple elements wherein the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and
vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not
exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. The
amount or timing of the Company&#146;s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in
these judgments or estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special
pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs, in the same period that the related
revenue is recorded. Such reductions to revenue are based on a number of factors, including the
contractual provisions of the customer agreements and the Company&#146;s assumptions related to
historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and inventory levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unearned revenues consist primarily of fees related to software products, license fees for
intellectual property, hardware product sales with continuing performance obligations and billings
on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Concentrations. </I></B>A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues is concentrated with a limited
number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated
by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from two customers of the Company&#146;s QCT and QTL
segments each comprised an aggregate of 18% and 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009,
compared to 16% and 14% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 and 13% and 14% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, respectively. Aggregated accounts receivable from three
customers comprised 48% of gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;27, 2009. Aggregated accounts
receivable from one customer comprised 60% of gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;28, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from international customers were approximately 94%, 91% and 87% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services Revenues. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily
comprised of the cost of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging and multimedia content delivery
services revenues and the cost of development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment
revenues consists of the cost of equipment sold, the amortization of certain intangible assets,
including license fees and patents, and sustaining engineering costs, including personnel and
related costs. Cost of messaging and multimedia content delivery services revenues consists
principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations expenses, including personnel and
related costs, depreciation, content costs and airtime charges by telecommunications operators.
Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes personnel costs and related
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Shipping and Handling Costs. </I></B>Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
equipment and services revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a
customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development. </I></B>Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed
as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility
of the software is established.

certain of the Company&#146;s products and services, subject to defined criteria. Cooperative marketing
costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent that a marketing
benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the cash paid does not exceed
the fair value of that marketing benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the fair value of
the marketing benefit received is recorded as a reduction in revenues in the same period the
related revenue is recorded. Cooperative marketing expense is recorded immediately when payments
are advanced to the customer or as the costs are incurred by the customer when payments are not
advanced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in
income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company
includes interest and penalties related to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits,
within the provision for income taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation
of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The
first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on
audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized
upon settlement. While the Company believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on
its tax returns, the Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax
authorities in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company continually
assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision,
income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a
revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options
directly to stockholders&#146; equity only when realized. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual
tax benefit realized by the Company upon an employee&#146;s disposition of a share-based award exceeds
the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that the Company had recorded. When
assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, the Company
follows the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions
are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cash Equivalents. </I></B>The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies&#146; securities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketable Securities. </I></B>The appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined
at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies
available-for-sale securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and
their availability for use in current operations. Actively traded available-for-sale securities are
stated at fair value as determined by the security&#146;s most recently traded price at the balance
sheet date. If securities are not actively traded, fair value is determined using other valuation
techniques, such as matrix pricing. The net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of
income tax. The realized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the
specific identification method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses securities in an unrealized loss position to
determine whether the unrealized loss is other than temporary. The Company considers factors
including: the significance of the decline in value compared to the cost basis, underlying factors
contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class, how long the market
value of the security has been less than its cost basis, the security&#146;s relative performance versus
its peers, sector or asset class, expected market volatility and the market and economy in general,
analyst recommendations and price targets, views of external investment managers, news or financial
information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall
industry in which the investee operates.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;amended the existing guidance
on determining whether an impairment for investments in debt securities is other-than-temporary.
Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, if the debt security&#146;s market value is below
amortized cost and the Company either intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not
that the Company will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, the Company
records an other-than-temporary impairment charge to investment income (loss)&nbsp;for the entire amount
of the impairment. For the remaining debt securities, if an other-than-temporary impairment exists,
the Company separates the other-than-temporary impairment into the portion of the loss related to
credit factors, or the credit loss portion, and the portion of the loss that is not related to
credit factors, or the noncredit loss portion. The credit loss portion is the difference between
the amortized cost of the security and the Company&#146;s best estimate of the present value of the cash
flows expected to be collected from the debt security. The noncredit loss portion is the residual
amount of the other-than-temporary impairment. The credit loss portion is recorded as a charge to
investment income (loss), and the noncredit loss portion is recorded as a separate component of
other comprehensive income (loss). Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the entire
other-than-temporary impairment loss was recognized in earnings for all debt securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When calculating the present value of expected cash flows to determine the credit loss portion
of the other-than-temporary impairment, the Company estimates the amount and timing of projected
cash flows, the probability of default and the timing and amount of recoveries on a
security-by-security basis. These calculations use inputs primarily based on observable market
data, such as credit default swap spreads, historical default and recovery statistics, rating
agency data, credit ratings and other data relevant to analyzing the collectibility of the
security. The amortized cost basis of a debt security is adjusted for any credit loss portion of
the impairment recorded to earnings. The difference between the new cost basis and cash flows
expected to be collected is accreted to investment income (loss)&nbsp;over the remaining expected life
of the security.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities that are accounted for as equity securities include investments in common stock,
equity mutual and exchange-traded funds and debt mutual funds. For equity securities, the Company
considers the loss relative to the expected volatility and the likelihood of recovery over a
reasonable period of time. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of an
equity security has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to
investment income (loss)&nbsp;for the difference between fair value and cost at the balance sheet date.
Additionally, if the Company has either the intent to sell the security or does not have both the
intent and the ability to hold the equity security until its anticipated recovery, the Company
records a charge to investment income (loss)&nbsp;for the difference between fair value and cost at the
balance sheet date.
</DIV>

estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#146;s customers to make required payments.
The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably
assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic
industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to
ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request
financial information, including financial statements or other documents to ensure that the
customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably
assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon
receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers was to deteriorate,
adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company uses the implied volatility of market-traded options in the Company&#146;s stock
for the expected volatility assumption. The term structure of volatility is used up to
approximately two years, and the Company uses the implied volatility of the option with the longest
time to maturity for periods beyond two years. The selection of implied volatility data to estimate
expected volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Company&#146;s
stock and the Company&#146;s assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock
price trends than historical volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the terms of the Company&#146;s employee stock options. The Company does not target a specific dividend
yield for its dividend payments but is required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the
binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company&#146;s history and expectation of
future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. The post-vesting
forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factor are based on the Company&#146;s historical option
cancellation and employee exercise information, respectively. The post-vesting forfeiture rate
represents the rate at which stock options are expected to be forfeited by employees subsequent to
their vest dates. The suboptimal exercise factor is the ratio by which the stock price must
increase over the exercise price before employees are expected to exercise their stock options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. The
expected life of employee stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions used in
the Company&#146;s binomial model. The binomial model assumes that employees&#146; exercise behavior is a
function of the options&#146; remaining contractual life and the extent to which the option is
in-the-money (i.e., the average stock price during the period is above the strike price of the
stock option). The binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two
variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations of past grants made by the Company.
The expected life of employee stock options granted, derived from the binomial model, was 5.6
years, 5.9&nbsp;years and 6.2&nbsp;years during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

compensation expense during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to share-based awards
granted during those periods. The remaining share-based compensation expense primarily related to
stock option awards granted in earlier periods. In addition, for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, $79
million, $408&nbsp;million and $240&nbsp;million, respectively, was presented as financing activities in the
consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect the incremental tax benefits from stock options
exercised in those periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Foreign Currency. </I></B>Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local currency environment use the local
currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation gains or losses are recognized as a
component of other comprehensive income. Where the United States dollar is the functional currency,
resulting translation gains or losses are recognized in the statements of operations. Transaction
gains or losses related to balances denominated in a different currency than the functional
currency are recognized in the statement of operations. Net foreign currency transaction gains
included in the Company&#146;s statement of operations were negligible in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Comprehensive Income. </I></B>Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities. The Company presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of
stockholders&#146; equity. The reclassification adjustment for net realized gains results from the
recognition of the net realized gains in the statements of operations when marketable securities
are sold or derivative instruments are settled. The reclassification adjustment for
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities included in net income results from the
recognition of the unrealized losses in the statements of operations when they are no longer viewed
as temporary. The portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to noncredit factors
and subsequent changes in fair value included in comprehensive income is shown separately from
other unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Earnings Per Common Share. </I></B>Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted
earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of dilutive common
share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company&#146;s share-based compensation plans
and shares subject to written put options, and the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. Dilutive common share equivalents include the dilutive
effect of in-the-money share equivalents, which is calculated based on the average share price for
each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of
an option, the amount of compensation cost, if any, for future service that the Company has not yet
recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if
any, when the option is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current
period. The incremental dilutive common share equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock
method, for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 16,900,000, 27,618,000 and 32,333,000, respectively.

stock during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would be anti-dilutive. The
computation of diluted earnings per share excluded 781,000 and 404,000 shares of common stock
issuable under our employee stock purchase plans during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, because
the effect on diluted earnings per share would be anti-dilutive. Put options outstanding during
2008 and 2007 to purchase 1,607,000 and 1,456,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were not
included in the earnings per common share computation because the put options&#146; exercise prices were
less than the average market price of the common stock while they were outstanding, and therefore,
the effect on diluted earnings per common share would be anti-dilutive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Future Accounting Requirements. </I></B>In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance
for business combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a
business combination (i)&nbsp;recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii)
recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase and (iii)&nbsp;determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The guidance
will be effective for the Company&#146;s fiscal 2010 beginning September&nbsp;28, 2009 and will change the
Company&#146;s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements in September&nbsp;2006, which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. The Company adopted the
provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective September&nbsp;29, 2008 but
elected a partial deferral under the provisions related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including goodwill, wireless licenses, other
intangible and long-lived assets, guarantees and asset retirement obligations. The adoption of this
guidance in fiscal 2010 on such nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB ratified the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF)&nbsp;that revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple
deliverables. The guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should
be allocated among the separate units of accounting. The guidance will be effective for the
Company&#146;s fiscal 2011 beginning September&nbsp;27, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The guidance may
be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. The
Company is in the process of evaluating early prospective adoption and determining the effects, if
any, the adoption of the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB also ratified the final consensus reached by the EITF that
modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a)&nbsp;non-software
components of tangible products and (b)&nbsp;software components of tangible products that are sold,
licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components
of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product&#146;s essential
functionality. The guidance will be effective for the Company&#146;s fiscal 2011 beginning September&nbsp;27,
2010 with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively
for new or materially modified arrangements. The Company is in the process of evaluating early
prospective adoption and determining the effects, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on
its consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective September&nbsp;29, 2008, the first day of the Company&#146;s fiscal year 2009, the Company
adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and the fair value option for
financial assets and financial liabilities. The Company did not record an adjustment to retained
earnings as a result of the adoption of the guidance for fair value measurements, and the adoption
did not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. The guidance for the fair
value option for financial assets and financial liabilities provides companies the irrevocable
option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings. The Company has not elected to measure any financial assets or liabilities
at fair value that were not previously required to be measured at fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the
measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value
that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by
requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs
market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market
data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect
the Company&#146;s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or
liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

well as assumptions related to liquidity and credit valuation adjustments of
marketplace participants. Level 3 assets primarily consist of certain marketable debt
instruments whose values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and

investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when
they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded $20
million in other-than-temporary impairments on such assets, which were based on fair value
measurements classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investments in marketable securities at September
27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008 were caused primarily by a prolonged disruption in global financial
markets that included a deterioration of confidence and a severe decline in the availability of
capital and demand for debt and equity securities. The result has been depressed securities values
in most types of securities, including investment- and non-investment-grade debt obligations,
mortgage- and asset-backed securities, equity securities, equity mutual and exchanged-traded funds
and debt mutual funds. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, the Company concluded that the unrealized losses were
temporary. Further, for equity securities, equity mutual and exchange-traded funds and debt mutual
funds with unrealized losses, the Company has the ability and the intent to hold such securities
until they recover, which is expected to be within a reasonable period of time. For debt securities
with unrealized losses, the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than
not that the Company will be required to sell, such securities before recovery or maturity.
</DIV>

securities held by the Company as of the dates indicated and the corresponding changes in such

receivable that was paid in October&nbsp;2008. Investment receivables at September&nbsp;28, 2008 primarily
related to amounts due for redemptions of money market investments for which the Company received
partial payment in fiscal 2009, and the remaining $48&nbsp;million net receivable was recorded in other
assets at September&nbsp;27, 2009, substantially all of which was classified as noncurrent due to the
uncertainty regarding the timing of distributions.

2009, 2008 and 2007 was $428&nbsp;million, $372&nbsp;million and $317&nbsp;million, respectively. The gross book
values of property under capital leases included in buildings and improvements were $190&nbsp;million
and $140&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008, respectively. These capital leases
principally related to base station towers and buildings. Amortization of assets recorded under
capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Capital lease additions during fiscal 2009,
2008 and 2007 were $50&nbsp;million, $51&nbsp;million and $33&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008, buildings and improvements and leasehold
improvements with aggregate net book value of $56&nbsp;million and $63&nbsp;million, respectively, including
accumulated depreciation and amortization of $9&nbsp;million and $6&nbsp;million, respectively, were leased
to third parties or held for lease to third parties. Future minimum rental income on facilities
leased to others in fiscal 2010 to 2014 is expected to be $8&nbsp;million, $6&nbsp;million, $6&nbsp;million, $3
million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, and zero thereafter.

goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for annual impairment testing
purposes. Goodwill was allocable to reporting units included in the Company&#146;s reportable segments
at September&nbsp;27, 2009 as follows: $434&nbsp;million in Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, $675&nbsp;million in
Qualcomm Technology Licensing, $255&nbsp;million in Qualcomm Wireless &#038; Internet, and $128&nbsp;million in
Qualcomm MEMS Technology (a nonreportable segment included in reconciling items in Note 10). The
decrease in goodwill from September&nbsp;28, 2008 to September&nbsp;27, 2009 was the result of adjustments to
acquired deferred tax assets and currency translation adjustments, partially offset by a business
acquisition.

fiscal 2008 is being examined by the IRS, which is expected to be completed no later than May&nbsp;2010.
The Company is participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program, whereby the IRS and the
Company endeavor to agree on the treatment of all issues in the fiscal 2009 tax return prior to the
return being filed. The Company is subject to examination by the California Franchise Tax Board for
fiscal years after 2002 and is currently under examination for fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005. The
Company is also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the United States and
around the world, many of which are open to tax examinations for periods after fiscal 2002.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2007, the Internal Revenue Service completed audits of the Company&#146;s tax returns
for fiscal 2003 and 2004, resulting in adjustments to the Company&#146;s net operating loss and credit
carryover amounts for those years. The tax provision was reduced by $331&nbsp;million during fiscal 2007
to reflect the known and expected impacts of the audits on the reviewed and open tax years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;27, 2009, the Company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of
$131&nbsp;million expiring from 2015 through 2028, unused state net operating loss carryforwards of $202
million expiring from 2012 through 2029, and unused foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $47
million, with $46&nbsp;million expiring from 2012 through 2015. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, the Company had
unused state income tax credits of $5&nbsp;million, which do not expire. The Company does not expect its
federal net operating loss carryforwards and its state income tax credits to expire unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes, more likely than not, that it will have sufficient taxable income after
stock option related deductions to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets. As of September
27, 2009, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on foreign and state net operating losses
and net capital losses of $17&nbsp;million and $55&nbsp;million, respectively, of which $278&nbsp;million was
recorded as an increase in other comprehensive income in fiscal 2009. The valuation allowances
reflect the uncertainty surrounding the Company&#146;s ability to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions to utilize its net operating losses and the
Company&#146;s ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrecognized tax benefits at September&nbsp;27, 2009 include $44&nbsp;million for tax positions
that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The reduction in unrecognized tax
benefits in fiscal 2009 related primarily to the impacts of various federal, state and foreign tax
audits. Due to the anticipated resolution of additional tax audits during fiscal 2010, it is likely
that the Company&#146;s unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next twelve months and result
in adjustments to the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets, income taxes payable and income tax provision.
Interest expense related to uncertain tax positions was negligible in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.
The amount of accrued interest and penalties was negligible at September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28,
2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $516&nbsp;million, $360&nbsp;million
and $233&nbsp;million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The income taxes paid are primarily
related to foreign withholding taxes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted. The bill
extends the research and development tax credit for calendar year 2008 and 2009 and increases the
Alternative Simplified Credit rate from 12% to 14% in calendar 2009. The Company recorded an
additional research and development tax credit related to fiscal 2008 of approximately $38&nbsp;million
in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the period in which the research and development tax credit

in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution of
preferred share purchase rights, 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, and such shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of
the preferred share purchase rights. At September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008, no shares of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement. </I></B>The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Agreement (Rights Agreement) to protect stockholders&#146; interests in the event of a proposed takeover
of the Company. Under the original Rights Agreement, adopted on September&nbsp;26, 1995, the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company&#146;s
common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated on December&nbsp;7,
2006, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-thousandth
share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, subject to
adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $180. The Rights are exercisable
only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock without approval of the Board of Directors. Upon
exercise, holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to
receive the Company&#146;s common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value,
as defined, equal to twice such purchase price. The Rights, which expire on September&nbsp;25, 2015, are
redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company&#146;s option prior to the time such Rights are
triggered for a price of $0.001 per Right.

to repurchase up to $2.0&nbsp;billion of the Company&#146;s common stock. The stock repurchase program has no
expiration date. When stock is repurchased and retired, the amount paid in excess of par value is
recorded to paid-in capital. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased and retired
8,920,000, 42,616,000 and 37,263,000 shares of common stock, respectively, for $284&nbsp;million, $1.7
billion and $1.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, before commissions and excluding $14&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million
of premiums received related to put options that were exercised in fiscal 2008 and 2007,
respectively. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion remained authorized for repurchase
under the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options on its
own stock during fiscal 2007. At September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008, no put options remained
outstanding. During fiscal 2008, the Company recognized gains of $6&nbsp;million in investment income
due to decreases in the fair values of put options, including premiums received of $14&nbsp;million.
During fiscal 2007, the Company recognized $3&nbsp;million in investment losses due to net increases in
the fair values of put options, net of premiums received of $17&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;2, 2009, the Company announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on the
Company&#146;s common stock, payable on December&nbsp;23, 2009 to stockholders of record as of November&nbsp;25,
2009, which will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan. </I></B>The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The
Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make additional
contributions based upon earnings. The Company&#146;s contribution expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007 was $46&nbsp;million, $45&nbsp;million and $39&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Compensation Plans. </I></B>The Board of Directors may grant options to selected employees,
directors and consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a
price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2006 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) was adopted during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and replaced
the 2001 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Non-Employee Directors&#146; Stock Option Plan and their
predecessor plans (the Prior Plans). The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and
nonstatutory stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards and is the source of shares issued
under the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (ERMCP). The share reserve under the 2006
Plan was 405,284,000 at September&nbsp;27, 2009. Shares subject to any outstanding option under a Prior
Plan that is terminated or cancelled (but not an option under a Prior Plan that expires) following
the date that the 2006 Plan was approved by stockholders, and shares that are subject to an award
under the ERMCP and are returned to the Company because they fail to vest, will again become
available for grant under the 2006 Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company may amend or
terminate the 2006 Plan at any time. Certain amendments, including an increase in the share
reserve, require stockholder approval. Generally, options and restricted stock units outstanding
vest over periods not exceeding five years. Options are exercisable for up to ten years from the
grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2008, the Company assumed a total of approximately 1,462,000 outstanding stock
options under various stock-based incentive plans that were assumed (the Assumed Plans) as a result
of acquisitions. The Assumed Plans were suspended on the dates of acquisition, and no additional
shares may be granted under those plans. The Assumed Plans provided for the grant of both incentive
stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not
exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s determination of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company&#146;s stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, total unrecognized
estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.4
billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3&nbsp;years. The total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $272&nbsp;million, $1.3
billion and $708&nbsp;million, respectively. The Company recorded cash received from the exercise of
stock options of $534&nbsp;million, $1.1&nbsp;billion and $479&nbsp;million and related tax benefits of $106
million, $492&nbsp;million and $272&nbsp;million during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Upon option
exercise, the Company issues new shares of stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2008, the Company granted 55,000 restricted stock units to certain employees,
all of which remain unvested at September&nbsp;27, 2009. The weighted-average fair value per share of
the restricted stock units awarded in fiscal 2008 was $54.42 calculated based on the fair value of
the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant of each award. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, the total
unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock units granted prior
to that date was negligible.

first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize the Company to
withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any offering period, subject to certain
limitations. In fiscal 2008, the Company amended the employee stock purchase plan to include a
non-423(b) plan. The employee stock purchase plan authorizes up to approximately 24,709,000 shares
to be granted. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 3,654,000, 2,951,000 and 2,650,000
shares, respectively, were issued under the plans at an average price of $29.72, $35.96 and $32.08
per share, respectively. At September&nbsp;27, 2009, approximately 3,971,000 shares were reserved for
future issuance.

executives to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis, the
Company matches up to 10% of the participants&#146; deferral in Company common stock under the ERMCP
based on the then-current market price, to be distributed to the participant upon eligible
retirement. The income deferred and the Company match held in trust are unsecured and subject to
the claims of general creditors of the Company. Company contributions vest based on certain minimum
participation or service requirements and are fully vested at age 65. Participants who terminate
employment forfeit their unvested shares. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 153,000,
96,000 and 126,000 shares, respectively, were allocated under the plans, and the Company recorded
$6&nbsp;million, $6&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million in compensation expense, respectively, related to its net

U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#146;s (USPTO)&nbsp;Central Reexamination Unit has issued office actions
rejecting all of the asserted patent claims on the grounds that they are invalid in view of certain
prior art and has made these rejections final; Tessera has appealed the rejections to the Board of
Appeals and Interferences. On December&nbsp;1, 2008, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;ruled that the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint: </I>Two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and
two South Korean companies (Nextreaming Corp. and Thin Multimedia, Inc.) filed complaints with the
Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC)&nbsp;alleging that certain of the Company&#146;s business practices
violate South Korean anti-trust regulations. On February&nbsp;17, 2009, the KFTC issued a Case
Examiner&#146;s report setting forth allegations with respect to the lawfulness of certain business
practices related to the Company&#146;s integration of multimedia solutions into its chipsets, rebates
and discounts provided to its chipset customers and of certain licensing practices. As a result of
its agreement with the Company, in May&nbsp;2009 Broadcom withdrew its complaint to the KFTC. Hearings
before the KFTC commenced on May&nbsp;27, 2009, and on July&nbsp;23, 2009 the KFTC announced its ruling,
although the written decision has not yet been issued. The KFTC announced that it found the Company
to be in violation of South Korean law by offering certain discounts and rebates for purchases of
its CDMA chips and that it would levy a fine of at least 260&nbsp;billion Korean won, as well as order
the Company to cease the practices at issue. Subject to the issuance and review of the KFTC&#146;s
written decision, the Company intends to appeal the decision. As a
result of this announcement, the Company recorded a $230&nbsp;million
charge during fiscal 2009. The Company does not
anticipate that the cease and desist remedies ordered will have a material effect on its
operations. In July&nbsp;2009, the KFTC also announced that it would continue its review of the
Company&#146;s integration of multimedia functions into its chipsets, but it has not announced any
decisions in that regard. The Company believes that its practices do not violate South Korean
competition law, are grounded in sound business practice and are consistent with its customers&#146;
desires.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Japan Fair Trade Commission Complaint</I>: The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)&nbsp;has received
unspecified complaints alleging that the Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation
of Japanese law. On September&nbsp;29, 2009, the JFTC issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO)&nbsp;concluding
that the Company&#146;s Japanese licensees were forced to cross-license patents to the Company on a
royalty-free basis and were forced to accept a provision under which they agreed not to assert
their essential patents against the Company&#146;s other licensees who made a similar commitment in
their license agreements with the Company. The CDO seeks to require the Company to modify its
existing license agreements with Japanese companies to eliminate these provisions while preserving
the license of the Company&#146;s patents to those companies. The Company disagrees with the conclusions
that it forced its Japanese licensees to agree to any provision in the parties&#146; agreements and that
those provisions violate Japan&#146;s Anti-Monopoly Act. The Company intends to invoke its right under
Japanese law to an administrative hearing before the JFTC, request that the JFTC suspend the CDO
pending a decision following the hearing, and seek a stay of the CDO from the Japanese courts
should the JFTC deny the Company&#146;s request to suspend the CDO.

wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action
lawsuits, and individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., seeking
monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. Two of the cases in which the Company
has been named as a defendant have been dismissed by the lower courts and are now on appeal by the
plaintiffs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 5, 2009, Panasonic filed an arbitration demand alleging that it does not owe royalties,
or owes less royalties, on its WCDMA subscriber units, and that the Company breached the license
agreement between the parties as well as certain commitments to standards setting organizations. The
arbitration demand seeks declaratory relief regarding the amount of royalties due and payable by
Panasonic, as well as the return of certain royalties it had previously paid. The Company has responded to
the arbitration demand, denying the allegations and requesting judgment in its favor on all claims.
Although the Company believes Panasonic&#146;s claims are without merit, it has deferred the recognition of
revenue related to WCDMA subscriber unit royalties reported and paid by Panasonic in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2009 because, among other reasons, the matter has been submitted to arbitration for resolution.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2008, a complaint was filed in San Diego Federal Court on behalf of a purported
class of individuals who purchased CDMA devices or service, seeking damages and injunctive relief
under federal and/or state antitrust and unfair competition laws and common law as a result of the
Company&#146;s licensing practices. On March&nbsp;3, 2009, the court granted the Company&#146;s motion and
dismissed the complaint. On April&nbsp;2, 2009, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint re-asserting
some, but not all, of the claims in its original complaint. On August&nbsp;10, 2009, the court granted
the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of standing. However, the court may
reopen the case in the event an appeals court reverses a decision in an unrelated case involving
different parties but raising a similar standing issue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, the Company believes the claims made by

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the <I>Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint</I>, the Company has not recorded any accrual for
contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on the Company&#146;s
belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range
of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal
actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance,
believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its
operating results, liquidity or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i>Litigation
Settlement, Patent License and Other Related Items.</i></b> Since 2005, the Company and Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom) had
 been engaged in a series of complex legal disputes in various forums, including various claims by
Broadcom that alleged infringement by the Company of certain Broadcom patents.  The Company
believed that these claims were without merit for a variety of reasons, including the Company&#146;s successful
preparation and deployment of technical &#147;design arounds&#148; (i.e., technical modifications, such as redesigns
of the hardware or implementation of new software, to change the structure or function accused of
infringing) for certain products where infringement claims had been made as well as findings by
USPTO examiners in the reexamination process that the asserted claims of certain of the related patents were
invalid.  However, in order to settle the litigation to enable the Company to move forward with its
business and focus on restoring its relationships with its customers and carriers, on April 26, 2009, the
Company entered into a Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement (the Agreement) with
Broadcom. Under the Agreement, (i) the companies agreed to terminate all litigation between
the parties; (ii) Broadcom agreed to assign certain patent rights to the Company; and (iii) the companies
granted certain rights to each other under their respective patent portfolios, including agreements not to
assert certain patents as well as an exhaustive license to certain patents that were the subject of litigation
between the parties and to portions of related patents for integrated circuit and software products. The
Company agreed to pay Broadcom $891 million, of which $243 million was paid in fiscal 2009 and the
remainder will be paid ratably through April 2013. At September 27, 2009, the remaining liability was
$612 million, which approximated the fair value as estimated by discounting the future cash flows using a
discount rate that reflects the estimated rate at which the Company could obtain financing with similar
 terms at September 27, 2009.</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for the Agreement depends to a large
extent upon the ability to reliably value the assets received. This, in turn, requires that
significant judgment be exercised in arriving at certain estimates and
assumptions, including the selection of appropriate valuation techniques. As
the non-assert provision between the parties did not meet the definition of an asset, no value was ascribed
to it in the settlement. The elements of the Agreement which potentially represented assets to the
Company comprised the assigned patents and the license to certain other patents; accordingly, the
Company endeavored to value these assets using a variety of techniques, including the market and income
approaches. The Company referred to several different sources of patent pricing information and also
considered the projected cost savings from not using its technical design arounds for the remainder of the
related patent life and using the patent instead. However, given the difficulty in reliably estimating the
value of the individual elements in the Agreement, the Company has treated the Agreement as a single
element for accounting purposes. The principal benefits to the Company from entering into the
Agreement were (i) the termination of litigation between the parties which allows the Company to avoid
future litigation expenses and (ii) the avoidance of future customer disruption; accordingly, the
predominant component of the arrangement was the litigation settlement. As a result, the Company
recorded a $783 million charge during fiscal 2009, including $35 million related to assets that
were initially capitalized. The  charge represented the difference between the total payment
obligation and the sum of amounts accrued in prior fiscal periods and imputed interest.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Indemnifications. </I></B>In general, the Company does not agree to indemnify third parties for losses
sustained from intellectual property infringement. However, the Company is contingently liable
under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers
against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent
infringement by products or services sold or provided by the Company. The Company&#146;s obligations
under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the
Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company. These
indemnification arrangements are not initially measured and recognized at fair value because they
are deemed to be similar to product warranties in that they relate to claims and/or other actions
that could impair the ability of the Company&#146;s direct or indirect customers to use the Company&#146;s
products or services. Accordingly, the Company records liabilities resulting from the arrangements
when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under indemnification
arrangements have not been material to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The Company
has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities at September&nbsp;27, 2009 associated with these
indemnification arrangements, other than negligible amounts for reimbursement of legal costs, based
on the Company&#146;s belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any
possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Purchase Obligations. </I></B>The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase
inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets and estimates its noncancelable
obligations under these agreements for fiscal 2010 to 2014 to be approximately $893&nbsp;million, $158
million, $76&nbsp;million, $23&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million, respectively, and $55&nbsp;million thereafter. Of
these amounts, commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories for fiscal 2010 and
2011 comprised $670&nbsp;million and $13&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Leases. </I></B>The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 35&nbsp;years and with provisions for
cost-of-living increases with certain leases. Rental expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $80
million, $75&nbsp;million and $60&nbsp;million, respectively. The Company leases certain property under
capital lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2043. Capital lease obligations are
included in other liabilities. The future minimum lease payments for all capital leases and
operating leases as of September&nbsp;27, 2009 are as follows (in millions):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss)&nbsp;before
income taxes (EBT). EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments,
including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain
income and charges are not allocated to segments in the Company&#146;s management reports because they
are not considered in evaluating the segments&#146; operating performance. Unallocated income and
charges include certain investment income, certain share-based compensation and certain research
and development expenses and marketing expenses that were not deemed to be directly related to the
businesses of the segments. The table below presents revenues, EBT and total assets for reportable

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable, finance receivables and inventories
for QCT, QTL and QWI. The QSI segment assets include certain marketable securities, notes
receivable, wireless licenses, other investments and all assets of QSI&#146;s consolidated subsidiary,
FLO TV, including property, plant and equipment. QSI&#146;s assets related to the FLO TV business
totaled $1.3&nbsp;billion, $1.2&nbsp;billion and $457&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;27, 2009, September&nbsp;28, 2008 and
September&nbsp;30, 2007, respectively. QSI&#146;s assets also included $10&nbsp;million, $20&nbsp;million and $16
million related to investments in equity method investees at September&nbsp;27, 2009, September&nbsp;28, 2008
and September&nbsp;30, 2007, respectively. Reconciling items for total assets included $389&nbsp;million,
$277&nbsp;million and $215&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;27, 2009, September&nbsp;28, 2008 and September&nbsp;30, 2007,
respectively, of goodwill and other assets related to the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division
(QMT), a nonreportable segment developing display technology for mobile devices and other
applications. Total segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of
unallocated corporate assets primarily comprised of certain cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill and other intangible
assets of nonreportable segments. The net book values of long-lived assets located outside of the
United States were $256&nbsp;million, $100&nbsp;million and $89&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;27, 2009, September&nbsp;28,
2008 and September&nbsp;30, 2007, respectively. The net book values of long-lived assets located in the
United States were $2.1&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;27, 2009 and September&nbsp;28, 2008 and $1.7&nbsp;billion at
September&nbsp;30, 2007.
