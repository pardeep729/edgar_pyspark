pleasure of the Board. The Committee may from time to time grant incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options (&#147;Stock Options&#148;), under the Plan to the persons described in Section&nbsp;3 hereof. No member of such Committee shall
be eligible to receive Stock Options under this Plan during his or her tenure on the Committee. Members of the Committee shall be subject to any additional restrictions necessary to satisfy the disinterested administration of the Plan as set forth
in Rule 16b-3 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Act&#148;) as it may be amended from time to time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(b)

members. Any decision reduced to writing and signed by a majority of the members shall be fully effective as if adopted by a majority at a meeting duly held. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have full and final authority to
determine the persons to whom Stock Options hereunder shall be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each Stock Option except that no optionee may be granted options for more than 1,000,000 shares during the life of the Plan, and whether
such Stock Option shall be designated an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; or a &#147;non-qualified stock option.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(c) No member of

any calendar year (under all plans of the employer corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporations) exceeds $100,000, such options shall be treated as options which are not incentive stock options. No Stock Options shall be granted pursuant

Stock Option is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Option Period&#148;). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5(c)(i) apply to any Stock Option held by an optionee whose employment terminated due to
