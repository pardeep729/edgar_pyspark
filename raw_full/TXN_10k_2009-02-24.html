granted under any such plan) shall be treated as Awards. </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>(c) In the event that any Option or
other Award granted hereunder (other than a Substitute Award) is exercised
through the delivery of Shares, or in the event that withholding tax liabilities
arising from such Option or Award are satisfied by the withholding of Shares by
the Company, the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan shall be
increased by the number of Shares so surrendered or withheld. For purposes of
this Section 5(c), awards and options granted under any previous option or
long-term incentive plan of the Company (other than a Substitute Award granted
under any such plan) shall be treated as Awards. </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>(d) Any Shares delivered pursuant to
an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or
of treasury Shares. </FONT></P>

reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,

warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company,
or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an
adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the
benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan,
then the Committee shall equitably adjust any or all of (i) the number and type
of Shares (or other securities or property) which thereafter may be made the
subject of Awards, including the aggregate and individual limits specified in
Section 5(a), (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or
property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant, purchase, or
exercise price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make
provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award;
<I>provided, however</I>, that the number of Shares subject to any Award
denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number. Any such adjustment with
respect to a &#147;stock right&#148; outstanding under the Plan, as defined in Section
409A of the Code, shall be made in a manner that is intended to avoid the
imposition of any additional tax or penalty under Section 409A.
