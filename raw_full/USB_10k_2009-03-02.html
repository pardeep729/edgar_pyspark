pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or
combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number
of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of
shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted
by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common

outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares

such other bank as may be acting as calculation agent for the Corporation, will request the

such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the
arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If
fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will

by the Corporation to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for

determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock

by this Section 7(a) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an
aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend
Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of

the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not
cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York
Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporation&#146;s securities may be listed) that
listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that
the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such
directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock

will hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders unless they have been
previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section&nbsp;7(a)(iv). In case any vacancy in the
office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the

always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of
any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of
