The Williams Pension Plan (&#147;Pension Plan&#148;) for the benefit of eligible employees of the Employers;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Sections&nbsp;401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (&#147;Code&#148;) establish
limitations as to the amount of pension benefit which may be accrued under or payable from the
Pension Plan on behalf of any participant therein; and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS Code Section&nbsp;409A imposes new requirements upon distributions from supplemental plans;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to reflect the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A, The Williams Companies, Inc.
desires to amend and restate The Williams Companies Retirement Restoration Plan, as effective
January&nbsp;1, 2005, a supplemental plan under which the portion of the pension benefit (and related
death benefit) of an eligible employee of an Employer which becomes subject to such limitations of
the Code shall be payable from general corporate assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, The Williams Companies, Inc. hereby adopts, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2008,
The Williams Companies Retirement Restoration Plan as amended and restated and set forth
hereinafter.

<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Introduction</U>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is generally effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and amends
and restates The Williams Companies Retirement Restoration Plan, as effective January&nbsp;1, 2005 (the
&#147;2005 Document&#148;), with respect to periods commencing on and after the Effective Date. It sets
forth the terms of the Plan applicable to deferrals which are subject to Section&nbsp;409A, <I>i.e.</I>,
generally, deferred amounts earned or vested after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the &#147;409A Program&#148;). Certain
other deferrals under the Plan shall be governed by a separate set of documents which set forth the
pre-Section&nbsp;409A terms of the Plan (the &#147;Pre-409A Program&#148;) to the extent such other deferrals and
the terms of Pre-409A Program are not incorporated into this document. Together, this document,
the 2005 Document and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single plan.
However, amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the
Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the
Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program
amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the Pre-409A
Program to remain exempt from Section&nbsp;409A. Subject to the applicable Plan termination provisions,
with respect to vested benefits under the Pre-409A Program: (i)&nbsp;in the case of vested Participants
on December&nbsp;31, 2004 who were receiving vested benefits on such date, such benefits shall continue
to be paid under the Pre-409A Program at the same time and in the same amounts as specified under
the form of payment in effect on such date; and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of vested Participants who were
not receiving vested benefits on such date, such benefits shall be paid under the Pre-409A Program

amendment does not increase the costs of the Plan and the Board is authorized to amend, modify,
restate or terminate the Plan; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;no such action by the Committee or the
Board shall reduce a Participant&#146;s Supplemental Retirement Benefit accrued as of the time thereof,
and (ii)&nbsp;any such amendments, modifications, restatement or termination shall be effectuated in a
manner which will not result in the imposition of Code Section&nbsp;409A penalties. Generally, the
amendment or termination of the Pre-409A Program shall be effectuated in a manner which either (A)
avoids causing the &#147;Grandfathered Benefits&#148; to be materially modified within the meaning of Treas.
Reg. 1.409A-6(a)(4); or (B)&nbsp;causes the Pre-409A Program to meet the requirements of Code Section
409A without the imposition of Code Section&nbsp;409A penalties. In this regard, upon termination of
the 409A Program due to a Change in Control, the Pre-409A Program shall be terminated either
pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-6(a)(4)(iii), or pursuant to a plan termination amendment which
causes the Pre-409A Program to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A. The date of such termination shall
be the first business day. Payments under the 409A Program may be accelerated only to the extent
permitted by Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4). In this regard, if a Change in Control occurs, the
service recipient entity that will be primarily liable immediately after the Change in Control
transaction for the payment of benefits under the 409A Program shall terminate the 409A Program and
all other nonaccount plans which are aggregated with the 409A Program under Treas. Reg.
1-409A-3(j)(4)(ix). The date of such termination shall be the first business day following such
Change in Control and all

and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be subject to attachment, execution,
garnishment, sequestration or other legal or equitable process. In the event a person who is
